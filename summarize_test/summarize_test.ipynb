      "A fabricated tweet attributed to former US President Donald Trump commenting on Oprah Winfrey's interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle circulated online. The claim is false as Trump's Twitter account remains suspended since January 2021, and the tweet uses an outdated format that Twitter stopped using in 2017.\n",
      "The US Supreme Court has rejected a case calling for the removal of President Joe Biden and hundreds of elected officials over baseless 2020 election fraud claims. Social media users falsely claimed the court would hear the case, but it has been dismissed twice. Legal experts say it is unlikely the Supreme Court will ever hear such a case, as it relies on a false narrative.\n",
      "US President Donald Trump did not tweet that South Africa's policy of black economic empowerment was \"economic segregation\". The claim was made by junk news website XpouZAR.com, which said the tweet had \"disappeared before going to press\". However, it is illegal for Trump to delete tweets while he is president, and a number of websites are dedicated to keeping track of everything he posts online.\n",
      "Rahul Kanwal, News director of India Today, claimed that President Donald Trump has suggested that India could have early access to COVID-19 vaccines being developed in the US since PM Modi accepted his “request” regarding Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Kanwal quoted a Fox News interview as the source of his claim.\n",
      "A Facebook post falsely claims that ABC chair Ita Buttrose endorsed Donald Trump in the 2020 US presidential election. While Buttrose supported Trump's criticism of Meghan Markle, she did not extend her endorsement to Trump as a leader. Buttrose has not publicly backed any candidate in the election.\n",
      "Fact-checking President Trump's farewell speech revealed that while military funding increased during his term, it was lower than Obama's first administration. The US economy did well before the pandemic, but there were periods when it performed better under previous administrations. Trump's claim of producing two vaccines is partially true, as Operation Warp Speed funded Moderna's development. Trump engaged in military actions abroad but started no new wars. The border wall saw 80 miles of new barriers, and unemployment rates for minority groups reached record lows before the pandemic.\n",
      "An image circulating online claims to show a tweet by President Trump declaring martial law on December 18, 2020. However, there is no evidence of the tweet on Trump's Twitter account or in a database of deleted tweets. Trump has since denied suggesting martial law.\n",
      "President Donald Trump is presenting a lopsided portrait of how the world does business with the U.S to rationalize his escalating trade dispute with allies. At the same time, he's glossing over aspects of the U.S. economy that don't support his faulty contention that it's the best it's ever been.\n",
      "A tweet claiming that former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao called Donald Trump a \"Chinese bitch\" is false. The tweet is from a satire account and does not appear on Chao's verified Twitter account. There is no record of the tweet on deleted tweet tracker Politwoops, and no credible news reports suggest Chao made such remarks.\n",
      "President Trump's claim that water supply policy has worsened California wildfires is baseless. There is no connection between the management of California's surface water supply and wildfires. There is no restriction on the use of water to fight fires, and the dryness of wildlands depends solely on weather, as they are not irrigated.\n",
      "A viral video claiming to show football fans watching Trump fire Liz Cheney is actually an altered 2016 video of fans celebrating England's victory against Wales. The video was created by a parody account and combined unrelated footage of Cheney and Trump. The claim is a misrepresentation.\n",
      "A viral post claiming that Donald Trump's Twitter account has been reinstated is false. The tweet in question was made by a parody account, @TheUltGmr, not Trump's official account, @realDonaldTrump, which remains suspended since January 2021.\n",
      "US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal has had a modest effect on rising gasoline prices, with one expert estimating the impact at \"maybe 3 to 5 cents per gallon\". The main driver of rising prices is OPEC's decision to curb oil production, which has been in place since late 2016. Other factors include a strong global economy and robust exports of US crude, gasoline and diesel fuel.\n",
      "A pro-Duterte Facebook page manipulated a post about a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to falsely claim that Trump said he couldn't handle his people and needed Duterte's help to solve the Covid-19 crisis. The original post by GMA News did not include this quote, and a search of Google and American news media sites showed that Trump never made such a statement.\n",
      "A video claiming to show the band of the Grenadier Guards playing the 'Imperial March' during President Trump's official welcome at Buckingham Palace has been debunked. The footage is real, but the theme was edited into the clip. Trump was actually played a medley of US military anthems.\n",
      "A clickbait headline claiming Melania Trump \"dumped\" Donald Trump is not supported by facts. Melania announced a partnership with social media platform Parler, while Donald plans to start a separate platform called 'TRUTH.' There is no evidence of an actual breakup between the couple.\n",
      "An outdated video of President Joe Biden is being falsely used to claim he admitted to coordinating Donald Trump's indictment to prevent him from regaining power. The clip is from a November 2022 press conference, where Biden discussed ensuring Trump doesn't become president again through legitimate constitutional efforts, not through the indictment.\n",
      "Donald Trump is the first former US president to be criminally indicted, facing charges over alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton came close to indictment but were not charged, while Ronald Reagan also narrowly avoided charges over the Iran-Contra Affair.\n",
      "A Facebook post claiming that former President Trump extended his power and is still in control of the US military is false. There is no constitutional authority for a president to extend their legal authority past their term. Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president on January 20, 2021, and is the Commander in Chief of the US military. The National Guard confirmed that all orders relating to the Capitol riots ended on May 23, 2021.\n",
      "A video shared on Facebook claiming that CNN said President Trump would win a second term is misleading. The video uses a clip from CNN anchor Fareed Zakaria predating the election in which he simply laid out a hypothetical way that Trump could win.\n",
      "A viral claim that former US President Donald Trump is back on Twitter is false. The screenshot of a tweet thanking Elon Musk for facilitating his return is from a parody account, not Trump's official account, which remains suspended.\n",
      "A viral image of a Time magazine cover featuring Hitler with an image of Trump as his moustache is false. The image is actually an artwork by Belgian cartoonist Luc Descheemaeker, who created it in 2016.\n",
      "A video claiming to show the arrest of an executive assistant to Joe Biden's campaign team on suspicion of spying on Donald Trump is false. The video actually shows the detention of Tomsk Mayor Ivan Klein in Russia in connection with a criminal case against him for abuse of office.\n",
      "Rumors that Donald Trump's personal plane was impounded due to him being a \"flight risk\" in the ongoing hush money investigation are false. There is no indication that authorities have impounded the plane, and it appears to still be in Trump's personal use. The claim originated from a satirical tweet with a photoshopped image.\n",
      "Interpol has denied Iran's claim that it issued red notices for the arrest of US President Donald Trump and other officials over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani. The international police organization said it would not consider such requests, citing Article 3 of its constitution, which forbids intervention in political, military, religious or racial activities.\n",
      "Mike Pence claimed that Joe Biden's plan to address COVID-19 was similar to the Trump administration's plan \"every step of the way.\" While there is some overlap in securing a vaccine and ramping up testing, Biden's plan includes proposed actions the Trump administration has not pursued and is focused on federal rather than state authority. The candidates' behaviors toward COVID-19 and views on science have also been significantly different. Pence's statement ignores critical facts and realities, making it inaccurate and ridiculous.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention has been fact-checked by various sources, with FactCheck.org stating that Clinton misrepresented what Trump said when she suggested he said he could fix everything by himself. FactCheck.Org also reports that Clinton's claim that the top 1% in the country are getting 90% of income gains is an outdated figure, and it is now 52%.\n",
      "A flyer claiming that Antifa is urging leftist groups to disguise themselves as Trump supporters for riots after the US election is false. The flyer has been circulating since 2017, and fact-checkers found no evidence of a connection between the flyer and Antifa groups.\n",
      "A rumour circulating on Twitter that Donald Trump supporter Robert Kinnison was the police officer who shot and killed Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has been proven false. Kinnison is a \"Christian, Conservative, gun rights activist\" from Lansing, Michigan, not a police officer in Baton Rouge.\n",
      "A fake news article claiming that President Trump has signed an executive order allocating $4,106 to every US citizen over the age of 65 has been debunked. The article, which appeared on the Last Line of Defense website, claimed that the measure would cost $40bn, which would be taken from social services such as food stamps and the CHIP program.\n",
      "A photo circulating on social media showing former US President Donald Trump holding a sign that reads \"The Delta Variant is Fake News\" is false. The image has been altered, and the original photo is from a 2017 event.\n",
      "Mail-in ballots are protected from fraud through several safeguards, including only sending ballots to valid voters, using hard-to-copy design elements, requiring voters to affirm their identity, using unique mail-ballot envelopes, having the Postal Service flag any oddities, and enforcing strict penalties for voter fraud. These measures make it difficult for individuals to commit voter fraud and nearly impossible to do so on a large scale.\n",
      "President Trump's claim that Vice President Mike Pence can reject electoral votes is false. Legal experts, like law professor Rebecca Green, argue that the 12th Amendment and the Electoral Count Act only give the Vice President a ministerial role in presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, not the power to overturn the will of voters.\n",
      "A Facebook post claiming that former US President Donald Trump was about to declassify a large number of documents is false. The photo in the post, showing Trump posing next to stacks of paper, is from a 2017 press event where he celebrated rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, and other industries. The stacks of paper represent regulations, not classified documents.\n",
      "The ad fairly states Booker's role in the passage of criminal justice reform with bipartisan legislation in a Republican-controlled Senate. While questions linger about the charter school strategy in New Jersey, the ad fairly credits Booker for his role in the sweeping changes, which include students now outperforming expectations at the highest rate in the nation, according to one analysis.\n",
      "A fake image of a 1998 interview with People Magazine has been debunked, in which Donald Trump allegedly said he would run as a Republican because they are the \"dumbest group of voters.\" People Magazine's extensive online archive shows that Trump was not interviewed by the publication in 1998.\n",
      "President Trump's claim that Iran's hostilities increased after the 2013 nuclear deal and that they were given $150 billion is misleading. The deal released about $100 billion in previously frozen Iranian assets, but much of it was tied up by debt obligations. A separate $1.7 billion transfer of cash to Iran was to settle a decades-long dispute and was agreed to in negotiations parallel to the nuclear deal.\n",
      "The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was filled with incorrect, misleading, and out-of-context statements. The debate covered five topics: the candidates' records, the Supreme Court, COVID-19, the economy, race and violence in cities, and the integrity of the election.\n",
      "President Trump tweeted false or misleading statements about the election he lost, including claims about Georgia's recount and Pennsylvania's mail-in ballots. Most of these tweets were flagged by Twitter.\n",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could open the door to making good on his promise to sell insurance across state lines. Whether it happens depends on the rules that finally emerge, and that's going to take some time.\n",
      "A photo claiming to show a pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C., on December 12 is actually an aerial view of the March for Our Lives gun control rally held in March 2018. The image was taken by Shannon Finney for Getty Images.\n",
      "A Facebook post claiming that President Trump announced the launch of a Covid-19 vaccine by Roche Medical Company is false. The video in the post shows Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics in North America, thanking the CDC and FDA for authorizing the emergency use of Roche's newly developed SARS-CoV-2 testing kits, not a vaccine.\n",
      "New York's five-year statute of limitations for felonies can be extended in some cases, such as when the defendant is not continuously present in the state. This may apply to former President Trump's case, as he was out of New York while serving as president from 2017 to 2021. Additionally, an executive order paused all statutes of limitations in New York for about seven months during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "President Trump's recent interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity revealed a lack of understanding of key policy issues and an inability to defend the Republican agenda. Trump's comments on trade policy, immigration, and NAFTA were misinformed and misleading. When asked why people should vote Republican, Trump failed to cite any specific policy agenda, instead resorting to fear-mongering and false claims about Democrats.\n",
      "A video claiming to show a pro-Trump crowd in NYC in March 2023 ahead of his expected indictment is actually from October 2020. The video was taken during a caravan of Trump supporters who gathered to support the former president after he tested positive for COVID-19.\n",
      "Donald Trump could not pardon himself of state charges brought in New York if he is re-elected president in 2024, as the Constitution only permits presidential pardons for federal crimes. Trump's recent indictment involves state crimes, which are considered offenses against that state and have their own process for administering pardons.\n",
      "Former President Trump cannot serve two more terms if reelected, as the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution limits an elected president to two terms in office, totaling eight years. Trump has already served one term, making him eligible for only one more term, even if nonconsecutive.\n",
      "Bank regulations were rolled back during the Trump administration, but it is unclear if the stricter requirements would have prevented the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. The 2018 rollback aimed to ease the burden on smaller institutions, but some argue that poor management decisions and overlooked red flags contributed to the banks' failures.\n",
      "A tweet supposedly from California Rep. Maxine Waters is not genuine, as it was posted by a now-suspended account @MaxinePWaters, rather than her real account, @RepMaxineWaters. The tweet was shared by a Facebook user called Bamboo Bob, who may not have known it was fake.\n",
      "A statement claiming to be from Donald Trump congratulating Elon Musk on his takeover of Twitter and suggesting Trump's account would be reinstated is fake. The statement circulated widely on social media but was debunked by journalists and not found on Trump's website, where he typically releases statements.\n"
