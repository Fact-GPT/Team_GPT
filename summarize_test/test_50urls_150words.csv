With the US midterm election less than a month away, social media posts claiming late-Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain predicted in 1993 that Donald Trump would be elected president are making the rounds. Posts quoting Cobain first went viral in 2016, but there is no evidence that the popular musician ever said such a thing.

""In the end I believe my generation will surprise everyone. We already know that both political parties are playing both sides from the middle and we'll elect a true outsider when we fully mature,"" starts a quote supposedly said by Cobain in 1993. It concludes, ""I wouldn't be surprised if it's not a business tycoon who can't be bought and who does what's right for the people. Someone like Donald Trump as crazy as that sounds.""

The quote has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, but never with any attribution as to where or exactly when it was said by Cobain.

The latest iteration is a meme including a black-and-white photo of Cobain during Nirvana’s famous MTV Unplugged performance in 1993. Nowhere in that performance does Cobain speak the quote.

In August 2016, fact-checking site Snopes reported that the hoax originated on a Facebook page called Trump Train.

In another sign that the quote is likely fabricated, the earliest version of the meme misspelled Cobain’s first name as Curt rather than Kurt.

A recent debunk of the meme appeared in August 2018 when Danny Goldberg, who was one of Nirvana’s managers when Cobain was alive, wrote in The Nation, “I know that the quote is not only made up but it is also a grotesque perversion of Kurt’s beliefs.”

While known to speak out against homophobia, a 2017 Rolling Stone magazine compilation of 12 great quotes from Cobain does not include broader statements on politics.

A Google search of the quote from before July 2016 only produced only two results: a page ranking blogs on Cobain which is no longer online and a page of Cobain memes.

CLAIM: The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case to remove President Joe Biden from office and reinstate former President Donald Trump in his place.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The Supreme Court has not decided to hear such a case. On Feb. 21, the justices rejected for a second time to hear a case that cites baseless 2020 election fraud claims to call for the court to oust from office hundreds of elected officials, including Biden, as well as to prevent them from holding any elected government position again. Several days later, a website published an article incorrectly stating that the case was going ahead, but the post has since been taken down.

THE FACTS: Nearly one week after the Supreme Court justices doubled down on their decision not to hear the suit, social media users falsely claimed the opposite.

One Instagram post shared a screenshot of a headline reading: “Supreme Court To Hear Case To Reinstate Donald Trump Over ‘Rigged’ Election.” It had received nearly 1,400 likes as of Wednesday.

The full article, which was published on Feb. 26, four days after the decision, stated that the court was “reconsidering hearing” the lawsuit “after previously dismissing it earlier this year.” It has since been taken down, and an article published on Feb. 28 by the same author correctly reports that the court rejected the case.

Other posts made days after the decision echoed the original article’s claim that the case still had a chance of being heard. They received tens of thousands of likes and shares on Twitter.

The suit — Adams v. Brunson, et al. — was previously dismissed by a lower court, and that ruling was upheld on appeal, according to court documents. It was then appealed to the Supreme Court in October 2022. The suit argues that Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, former Vice President Mike Pence and 385 members of Congress committed treason when they failed to probe baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged.

Further, it calls for the removal of these officials and a ban on their future ability to hold elected office, as well as “the swearing in of the legal and rightful heirs for President and Vice President of the United States.” It does not specifically name Trump.

In January 2023, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case and an appeal was filed later that month. The court rejected the case for a second time on Feb. 21.

Aziz Huq, a professor of law at the University of Chicago who is an expert on constitutional law, told The Associated Press that it is unlikely the Supreme Court will ever hear a case such as Adams v. Brunson, given that it relies on a false narrative.

“Certainly something that is founded upon the irresponsible conspiracy mongering fallacies that this petition is based upon seems to me an unlikely fodder for the Supreme Court,” he said.

The above message has been shared on Twitter and Facebook along with 40 second video clip of Donald Trump, President of the USA.

The above post is of August 2018, and has been shared over 1400 times. The video begins with Trump delivering a speech, followed by a voice which says ‘Allah Hu Akbar’. After this, commotion ensues as Trump is swiftly given cover by security personnel who rush to the stage.

The claim has been prevalent on social media over the last few months, shared widely by individual Facebook users on their timelines. It has also been posted on a page Main Bhi Ravish. July 2019 has seen a surge in share count.

Alt News found that the video has also been shared on Twitter by some users.

DOCTORED VIDEO CLIP

The video clip is doctored, with the ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ chant added to it. Alt News reverse-searched one of the key frames of the video clip, and found several articles related to the incident. According to reports, the incident had occurred in May 2016 at Dayton, Ohio in the USA, when a protester had attempted to breach the security cordon, prompting secret service agents to rush to Trump’s defense. NBC News stated,

“A campaign spokeswoman said that a man at the Dayton, Ohio, event “attempted to breach the secure buffer and was removed rapidly and professionally.” The suspect was identified as Thomas Dimassimo, 32, and was charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic — both misdemeanors, Chief Mike Etter of the Dayton Airport Police Department told NBC News. Dimassimo jumped the bike racks and tried to climb onto the stage, but was stopped by Secret Service stationed there, Etter said.”

It may be noted that in March 2016, Donald Trump was a presidential candidate of the Republican party.

A video report related to the incident was published by CNN in March 2016.

Posted below is a video of the same incident, shot from a different angle.

NO ‘ALLAH HU AKBAR’ CHANT

Alt News found that none of the videos of the incident featured the ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ chant which is heard in the viral video. Moreover, none of the news reports of the incident make any reference to any ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ chant. The video clip, shared on social media, is clearly edited.

The same video had been used earlier to falsely claim that Donald Trump was taken aback by Mexican music which suddenly started to play when he was delivering his speech.

A meme circulated by a pro-Labour Facebook page quotes New Zealand’s National Party leader, Judith Collins, as praising US president Donald Trump during the second debate of the 2020 election campaign.

The post features Ms Collins’ image alongside the quote: “He’s a damn sight better than any of the other Presidents that have been there before him, including those that you admire, Miss Ardern.”

Below the image are the words: “Judith Collins on Donald Trump.”

The October 1 Facebook post from the Backing the Kiwi Meme page is a screengrab of a Twitter post that carried the meme. The caption on Facebook reads: “Yikes.” At the time of writing, the post had been shared more than 740 times, attracting over 2300 reactions and 870 comments.

A meme with a purported Judith Collins quote praising Donald Trump is circulating on social media.

The Analysis

During the Newshub Leaders Debate on October 30, New Zealand’s two major party leaders touched on numerous topics, including US President Donald Trump.

Moderator Patrick Gower asked both leaders if they thought Mr Trump was “dangerous influence on the world”. (1hr 22min 35sec mark)

During the subsequent discussion, National leader Judith Collins referred to a recent agreement Mr Trump brokered to normalise relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, an agreement signed September 15.

It makes UAE only the third Arab state to formally recognise and open diplomatic relations with Israel, and the first since Jordan in 1994.

“(Mr Trump) has actually done some quite recent stuff with Israel and UAE and so actually that’s better than war, don’t you think?,” Collins said in response to Gower’s question. “He hasn’t been ready to rush into war.”

“It is a worry when the best thing you can say is at least we haven’t had war,” Labour leader Jacinda Ardern responded.

Ms Collins continued: “Well actually it’s a damn sight better than any of the other presidents that have been there before, including those that you admire, Ms Ardern. Actually I think keeping away from war is a good thing.”

Former US secretary of defense Robert Gates, who served under both presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, recently delivered similar praise on Meet the Press, saying: “Unlike (Mr Trump’s) three predecessors … at least he hasn’t started any new wars.” (6min 11sec mark)

Earlier Ms Collins said she thought Mr Trump “could have done better” with the COVID-19 response in the United States, and both leaders said they would work with whichever candidate won the election.

While the quote included in the Facebook meme is largely accurate, the word “it’s” in Ms Collins’ debate response – a reference to Mr Trump’s record in initiating wars – has been replaced with “he’s”, wrongly implying that the National leader said the current US president was better than all those before him.

National leader Judith Collins praised US President Donald Trump for not starting any wars.

The Verdict The Facebook meme includes a largely accurate quote, however a key word has been changed that alters its meaning. Ms Collins did not say Donald Trump was “a damn sight better” than previous presidents, only that it was better he had not started any wars, unlike his predecessors.

Image source, Reuters Image caption, Mr Trump took part in an event in Miami

Presidential Trump and Democratic rival for the White House, Joe Biden took part in separate town hall events taking questions from a moderator and members of the public.

We've fact-checked some of their claims.

Trump: ""Just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.""

Verdict: We can find no evidence to support this claim.

The president may have been referring to a study by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that found adults with Covid-19 were more than twice as likely to have reported eating at a restaurant before getting ill, compared to those without the disease.

The study found that 85% of the 150 respondents with coronavirus said they had always or often wore a mask in the two weeks before getting ill.

So the president misinterprets this - it does not show that 85% of people that wear masks in general, catch coronavirus.

The CDC has said: ""The interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.""

Image source, Reuters Image caption, Joe Biden was grilled over his plans for the Supreme Court

Biden: ""They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan.""

Verdict: That's not right. There are fewer US personnel in Afghanistan now than when Mr Obama left office.

President Trump has long called for troops to be brought home from operations abroad and has criticised US military interventions for being costly and ineffective.

At the end of the Obama administration, there were 9,294 active troops in Afghanistan and a total of 12,966 personnel if reserve and civilian numbers are also included, according to the US Department of Defense.

Mr Trump did order a further 3,000 personnel into Afghanistan in 2017, however since then numbers have been substantially reduced.

Earlier this month, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the US had less than 5,000 troops in Afghanistan.

Trump: ""We've given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country.""

Verdict: That's not right for tax cuts in general - previous ones have been larger. It is right for corporation tax.

We investigated this claim in 2018 shortly after Congress passed sweeping tax reform legislation. According to tax specialists, the cuts were big but not the biggest.

The Committee for a Responsible Budget looked at the numbers and reported that President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, compared to the overall size of the economy.

If you adjust the analysis for inflation, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall.

However tax experts also assessed Mr Trump's cut in corporation tax from 35% to 21%. Most said in absolute terms it was the biggest corporate tax cut in history.

Biden: ""There were 44 people [health experts working for the US] on the ground [in China]...All those 44 people came home, never got replaced.""

Verdict: The number of personnel working at the CDC office in China has fallen under President Trump, but Mr Biden's figures aren't right.

The United States has had a Centres for Disease Control (CDC) office in China for decades. The CDC is the top government body responsible for protecting public health.

Mr Biden is suggesting here that prior to the start of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the CDC office had been significantly depleted.

The overall number of CDC staff in China has come down significantly in recent years, but Mr Biden is not correct that they all left.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Coronavirus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan towards the end of 2019

The CDC website says that as of March this year there were 14 staff in total working in China - three from the US and 11 employed locally.

That's down from 47 CDC staff a year earlier, eight of whom were US employees and 39 of whom were locally recruited.

Health Secretary Alex Azar told journalists in late January that the US had offered on 6 January to send a team from the CDC - an offer that was repeated later that month and in February.

Two US experts did get into China as part of a multinational delegation from the World Health Organization, which went in mid-February.

Trump: ""GDP is going through the roof.""

Verdict: The latest numbers show a record fall in GDP during the pandemic. However the next set of figures, due out at the end of October, are expected to show a record increase.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the value of goods and services in the economy - and it's used to measure the size and health of a country's economy.

In the second quarter of 2020 - the latest available data accounting for April, May and June - the economy contracted by over 30%. That's more than the previous record 10% fall in 1958.

However, the figures for July, August and September - which are due out at the end of this month - are expected to show record growth but not enough to regain the losses during the pandemic so far.

Prior to the pandemic, during President Trump's first three years in office, Mr Trump oversaw an annual average growth of 2.5%.

The last three years of the Obama administration saw a similar level of growth (2.3%).

Biden: ""My deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal. The New Green Deal calls for elimination of all non-renewable energy by 2030.""

Verdict: The plan does not call for the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030.

The Green New Deal (GND) (not the ""New Green Deal"") is a plan put forward by Democrats on the progressive wing of the party.

Mr Biden is wrong in saying that the GND calls for the elimination of non-renewable energy sources by 2030. It actually calls for net-zero emissions by that date - which is quite different.

'Net zero' means greenhouse gas emissions are balanced by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere by, for example, by preserving forests and promoting renewable energy sources.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The Green New Deal calls for an expansion of renewable energy sources such as solar power

The GND resolution says ""it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.""","During separate town hall events, President Trump and Joe Biden made several claims that have been fact-checked. Trump claimed that 85% of people who wear masks catch Covid-19, but there is no evidence to support this. Biden stated that there are more US personnel in Afghanistan now than when Obama left office, which is incorrect. Trump claimed that he gave the greatest tax cut in US history, but this is only true for corporation tax.

FACT-CHECK

A look through Fox News's YouTube channel shows that the viral clip has been manipulated as the original news report was about a valet to Trump testing positive for COVID-19.

The word 'valet' has been edited out from the news ticker and audio of the clip that was uploaded on May 7, 2020, to Fox News's YouTube channel.









From the six seconds to 17 seconds mark, one can hear the same audio and visual in the viral clip except that 'a valet to' can be heard and seen in the ticker which changes the context.

""Just a moment ago Fox News Alert, The White House medical team confirming that a valet to President Trump has confirmed positive for the Coronavirus,"" says the anchor in the original clip.

We also found news reports stating that a member of the US Navy who serves as one of Trump's personal valets testing positive for coronavirus reported CNN on May 7, 2020. Additionally, we did not find any news reports on Trump testing positive for COVID-19.

Satire to misinformation



We also found a sarcastic clip which is 18 seconds long, and follows the same sequence as the viral clip, however after 11 seconds mark one can hear a sexual moaning sound and a 'no aprendes!' meme shows up which when translated from Spanish reads, ""You don't learn"".

By that gauge, the honors clearly go to Reagan, whose 1981 reduction amounted to 2.9 percent of GDP. A reputable research group's estimate puts President Donald Trump's version at 2.6 percent.

A lot of details on President Donald Trump's plan have to be filled in. But since the framework Mnuchin announced Wednesday adheres closely to the plan that Mr. Trump released during last year's election campaign, it's fair to use the analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which finds its impact at 2.6 percent.

Of course, there are many different ways of looking at data. In raw dollar terms, as adjusted for inflation, the largest was in 2010 under President Barack Obama, the Tax Foundation reports. Now, Mr. Obama is not well-known as a tax cutter, but he did need fiscal stimulus in the aftermath of the Great Recession. So one thing he did was to extend the tax cuts enacted under his predecessor, George W. Bush.

In its first year, that amounted to $420 billion. The Tax Foundation says that, adjusting that for inflation, ""Trump would have to cut taxes by at least $486 billion in 2018.""

Another approach is to see how how much tax rates dropped, which is customarily done by looking at the top bracket. Mr. Trump wants to lower the top rate to 35 percent from the current level of 39.6 percent -- or 4.6 percentage points.

By that yardstick, his plan is a piker. The largest decrease came under Warren G. Harding in the early 1920s, who faced a towering rate of 73 percent -- the legacy of World War I, when the U.S. was scrambling to enlarge the military. Under Harding, the top rate fell 29.5 percentage points.

In modern times, since World War II, the largest reduction came from the 1986 tax reform, enacted when Reagan was president and Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. In addition to wiping out many loopholes in the tax code, the tax overhaul dropped the top rate by 22 points, to 28 percent from 50 percent.

Second place, post-war, goes to Lyndon Johnson, who decreased the rate by 21 points, from 91 percent to 70 percent (a phased-in cut initiated under John F. Kennedy).","US President Donald Trump's tax cut plan is not the largest in the country's history, despite claims by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to the Tax Foundation research group. The best way to measure tax cuts is by charting the dollar amount of tax reduction as a percentage of GDP, the group said. By that measure, the largest tax cut was Ronald Reagan's in 1981, which amounted to 2.9% of GDP. Trump's plan is estimated to be 2.6%. In raw dollar terms, the largest tax cut was in 2010 under President Barack Obama, the Tax Foundation said."

Verdict: False

There is no evidence that this occurred. The video is from a 2022 congressional hearing.

Fact Check:

Trump stated in a Truth Social post that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, calling for the “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution” in order to overturn the election, according to CNN. The former president denied he had suggested the “termination” of the constitution, Politico reported.

The Facebook video, viewed more than 29,000 times, claims that a Biden aide was jailed by Trump. The video’s caption reads,”[SH0CKING]: ‘A FR.AUD IS RIGHT HERE’ Trump J.AILS Biden’s 2020 aide after DIRTY ‘wrong count’ admitting claim.”

However, there is nothing to indicate this occurred. If a 2020 aide to the Biden campaign had been arrested for voter fraud, media outlets would have covered it, yet none have. Check Your Fact also reviewed the Heritage Foundation’s election fraud database and did not find any instances of a Biden aide being arrested and jailed for voter or election fraud.

The Department of Justice has not issued any press releases announcing the arrest of any federal officials for election-related crimes. (RELATED: Did Ted Cruz Tell Merrick Garland That Dr. Fauci Should Be ‘Locked Up’?)

The video actually shows a July 20 House Homeland Security Committee hearing for election security. The man in the video speaking is Louisiana Republican Rep. Clay Higgins. Nowhere in the video is an aide for the Biden campaign arrested.

False claims regarding election fraud have circulated on social media in the wake of the 2022 midterm elections. Check Your Fact recently debunked a claim suggesting Arizona had 9 million registered voters despite a population of 7.2 million.","A video shared on Facebook claiming that former President Donald Trump jailed an aide of President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign for election fraud is false.

You can see a deeper discussion of California's wildfires are the result of hot, dry weather that has left the landscape dry and vulnerable to ignition. Wildlands are not irrigated, so water supply policy has no relation to wildfires. Climate trends have contributed to make fires more likely and more extreme in California, as have past fire-fighting practices. The continued development of land for homes and cities has also placed more buildings in areas of risk.You can see a deeper discussion of climate change's role in recent California fires here

REVIEW

CLAIM: California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!

Eric Kennedy, Assistant Professor, York University:

As CalFire has confirmed, water allocations are not influencing how wildfires are being fought in California. There’s enough access to water as it stands, and firefighters are effective in using a wide variety of other methods to augment water: chemical retardants, cutting fire breaks, and lighting backfires, among others. Wildfire has always been—and will always be—a part of North American landscapes, and our history is full of massive conflagrations all over the continent. Instead of water, other issues are far more important: where we build, how we build, how we prepare as individuals and communities, and how we improve our management approaches.

There are a whole host of explicit and implicit assertions in this presidential statement that are problematic. But perhaps the most demonstrably false of these is the notion that California water policy is the cause of the present severe wildfire situation. California has recently been experiencing record-breaking warmth, and the legacy of long-term drought is still apparent across much of the state. Vegetation dryness has approached or reached record levels, which is a direct result of high temperatures and (to a lesser extent) low precipitation. The severity of the ongoing wildfire situation in California can be partly attributed to the long-term warming trend and subsequent extreme dryness of vegetation, as well as the increasing encroachment of urban development into high-risk wildfire zones and (in some places) the legacy of forest management practices over the past century. (See the papers in this thread.)

Why is California water policy essentially irrelevant in this context? First, it’s unclear how water in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs would actually mitigate the vegetation dryness and risk of fire in regions far from these bodies of water. Second, firefighting agencies have virtually unlimited access to existing surface water supplies, and firefighting helicopters and “super scooper” planes have been utilizing just about every available water source in the ongoing firefight (from natural lakes to rivers to man-made reservoirs). CalFire has made it clear that a lack of water for firefighting purposes is not the problem—instead, the agency is struggling to cope with the unusually high number of very large fires and the extreme behavior/rapid rates of spread of those fires currently burning.","President Trump’s claim that water supply policy has worsened California wildfires is baseless. There is no connection between the management of California's surface water supply and wildfires. There is no restriction on the use of water to fight fires, and the dryness of wildlands depends solely on weather, as they are not irrigated.

10,408,A video shows Liz Cheney being fired by former U.S. president Donald Trump,Viral social media,2022-08-17T00:00:00Z,Digiteye India,digiteye.in,https://digiteye.in/video-of-football-fans-at-pub-viewing-trump-firing-liz-cheney-goes-viral-fact-check/,Video of football fans at pub viewing Trump firing Liz Cheney goes viral; Fact Check | Digit Eye,2022-08-21T00:00:00Z,FALSE,"Video of football fans at pub viewing Trump firing Liz Cheney goes viral; Fact CheckA Twitter post with a video clip has gone viral showing a crowd at a pub viewing former U.S. president Donald Trump telling Republican Representative Liz Cheney “Liz you are fired, get out of here”.

The video has gone viral in view of Liz Cheney, a ctitic of Trump, in news after she lost on Aug 16, 2022 to a Trump-backed primary challenger, Harriet Hageman. The user identified as @C3PMeme, as a satire but still it has generated several reactions here and here.

FACT CHECK

As the name suggested, it was a parody account though it generated several reactions making people believe that it was true. When we checked for the original video, we could trace it in Youtube to a footage in 2016 that showed football fans celebrating England’s victory against Wales in a Euro match. See the original video on YouTube here. The description reads that it was after the winning goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge.

The doctored video by @C3Meme showed two overlapping videos on the big screen – a message by Cheney on Aug. 17 after her defeat at the polls in the Republican primary in 2022. This video can be seen here and it has nothing to do with Trump. The sequel to it is another old video showing Trump, who was filmed on May 28, 2022, at a rally in Wyoming in support of Hageman predicting her defeat.

Hence, the 2016 pub video was altered to show that it was current and widely circulated on social media despite being a satire account.

Claim: A video shows Liz Cheney being fired by former U.S. president Donald Trump.

Conclusion: Altered 2016 video by a meme account meant for satire has gone viral as real.

Rating: Misrepresentation —","A viral video on Twitter, which appears to show a crowd at a pub watching former U.S. President Donald Trump fire Republican Representative Liz Cheney, has been debunked as a doctored video from a parody account.

Let’s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.



The archived version of the post can be found here.

Claim: Video of American President Donald Trump announcing that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19 next Sunday. Fact: In the video, American President Donald Trump hasn’t said that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19. He announced FDA’s approval of a Coronavirus ‘test’ developed by a company ‘Roche’ to increase and accelerate the country’s capacity to test for the virus. So, the claim isFALSE.

In the video clip posted, Donald Trump hands over the podium to Roche Diagnostics Chief Executive Officer for North America Matt Sause. Then Matt speaks- ‘Thank you, Mr. President. So, from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test. We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible because it’s critical for us to make that available to help patients in need, and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States. So, thank you’. After Matt’s speech, the clip ends with Trump saying- ‘And you can do it. You can do it. A great company’. So, in the video clip, Roche Diagnostics CEO for North America Matt Sause thanked FDA (U.S Food and Drug Administration) for rapid approval of the coronavirus test developed by their company.

When searched with keywords, the full video of the clip posted was found on ‘The White House’ website. In that video dated 13 March 2020 (Friday), Trump declares ‘National emergency’ and then opens $50 billion for the states and territories to fight against the disease. Later, Trump announces that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus test developed by ‘Roche’ to increase and accelerate the country’s capacity to test for the virus. He also said that he was expecting the availability of half a million additional tests early next week and would be announcing the locations for tests on Sunday. Later in the video, Vice President Pence and members of Coronavirus Task Force spoke in that press conference. From the Roche diagnostics website, it is found that the company has begun shipping of COVID-19 tests to laboratories across the US recently to begin testing of patients.



As per the website of U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH), currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with Coronavirus. But, Phase 1 of the clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine (mRNA-1273) designed to protect against COVID-19 has begun on 16 March. And it is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of that vaccine. The vaccine was developed by NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc.

To sum it up, in the video, American President Donald Trump has announced that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus ‘test’ developed by a company ‘Roche’.

12,4407,"""West Virginia is second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP.""",Donald Trump,2018-07-03T00:00:00Z,FactCheck.org,factcheck.org,https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/trump-overstates-west-virginia-gains/,Trump Overstates West Virginia Gains,2018-07-06T20:52:59Z,False,"Trump Overstates West Virginia GainsSpeaking to a crowd in West Virginia, President Donald Trump oversold the economic progress in the Mountain State on two fronts:

Trump said West Virginia “is second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP.” That was true at one time, but West Virginia ranked 44th in the most recent quarter. For all of 2017, West Virginia’s GDP ranked 10th.

Trump also said that “in West Virginia, per capita personal income grew more than 40 percent faster than the national average.” That’s a bit misleading. Per capita personal income in West Virginia — which is 25 percent lower than the national average — grew just $65 (or 5.5 percent) more than the national average.

West Virginia’s GDP

Trump’s comments were made at the Salute to Service Dinner at the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia – a state he won by 42 percentage points and frequently visits.

This is not the first time the president has said West Virginia has the second-fastest growing Gross Domestic Product. He said it in December 2017 – five months after the Bureau of Economic Analysis said, subject to future revision, that West Virginia’s economy grew at an annualized rate of 3 percent in the first quarter of 2017 – second only to Texas.

But that was a snapshot in time. West Virginia no longer has the second-fastest economy – even though the president continues to say it does.

Trump, July 3: Do you know that West Virginia is second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP? Think of what that means. And Jim just said, “Before we met Trump, that number was not good.” Pretty close to last, right? … But now, think of that. Texas was first. Texas. Doing a great job. Great governor there, too. But Texas was first. West Virginia was second — percentage increase of GDP. That’s an incredible accomplishment in a short period of time. Incredible.

The Texas economy did rank first in the fourth quarter of 2017, growing at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, according to the BEA’s most recent state estimates released in May. But West Virginia’s real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product grew by just 1 percent, significantly lagging the 2.7 percent nationwide average, and ranking 44th among states that quarter.

However, quarterly figures can fluctuate dramatically.

For the entirety of 2017, West Virginia’s real GDP rose by 2.6 percent. (See Table 4.) That was better than the national average of 2.3 percent, but puts West Virginia 10th among states — not second.

It is, however, an improvement. As Trump noted, West Virginia’s economic growth dramatically trailed the national average in each of the three years prior to 2017.

But Brian Lego, an economic forecaster at West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research, told us the state’s economic improvement has not been driven by any policies from the Trump administration.

Much of the turnaround in the state’s economy is tied to the energy industry, Lego said, particularly coal and natural gas (a conclusion also reached by the BEA). On the coal side, a small uptick after years of decline was largely due to an improvement in the international trade market that resulted in “a decent pop in coal production,” Lego said. The state started seeing that improvement for coal in the second and third quarter of 2016, Lego said, before Trump took office; and it has continued under Trump’s presidency.

The state also benefited from some improvement in the domestic natural gas market, he said.

Personal Income

Trump’s claim about West Virginia greatly outpacing the nation in per capita personal income growth begs some context.

Trump, July 3: Last year, in West Virginia, per capita personal income grew more than 40 percent faster than the national average.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, per capita personal income in West Virginia rose from $36,673 in 2016 to $37,924 in 2017. That’s an increase of $1,251, or 3.4 percent.

Nationally, per capita personal income rose from $49,213 in 2016 to $50,399 in 2017. That comes to an increase of $1,186, or 2.4 percent.

West Virginia’s per capita personal income in West Virginia grew just $65 — or 5.5 percent — more than the national average.

How does Trump arrive at his 40 percent figure?

West Virginia’s rate of growth was faster than the nation, because the state’s per capita personal income still trails the national average by about 25 percent. It ranks 49th in the U.S.

So, West Virginia’s per capital personal income, even though it was only $65 more than the national average, grew by 3.4 percent — 1 percentage point, or 40 percent higher, than the national average of 2.4 percent, as the president said.","US President Donald Trump has overstated the economic progress of West Virginia, claiming that the state is “second in the nation in the percentage increase of GDP”. While this was true at one point, West Virginia ranked 44th in the most recent quarter. For all of 2017, West Virginia’s GDP ranked 10th. Trump also said that “in West Virginia, per capita personal income grew more than 40 percent faster than the national average.” This is misleading, as per capita personal income in West Virginia, which is 25 percent lower than the national average, grew just $65 (or 5.5 percent) more than the national average."

U.S. President Donald Trump didn’t say he couldn't handle his people. He also didn’t say he needed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to help him solve the COVID-19 crisis.





The pro-Duterte Facebook page The 16th President of The Philippines manipulated an April 19 Facebook post of GMA News on the phone call Duterte got from Trump that day to make it look that way.

The genuine post, published at 10:16 p.m., reads:

The network uploaded two photos of Duterte on the phone, which it got from Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go’s Facebook page.





The 16th President of The Philippines did the following when it published its post about the phone call 12 minutes after GMA News did.





One, the Facebook page inserted a photo of Trump.





Two, it fabricated a quote in which the American president was supposed to have said:

I think I can't handle my people. I need help (sic) the President of the Philippines to solve (sic) Coronavirus (sic)

Three, it modified the text of GMA News’ post, removing the reference to journalist Joseph Morong and changing the URL to lead to the network’s page containing updates about COVID-19 instead to the story about the phone call.





It also replaced Duterte’s photo.





A search on Google and American news media sites showed Trump never made that quote. He also never tweeted such as statement.





In fact, little is known of Trump and Duterte's phone conversation beyond what presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in his April 20 briefing:

It was cordial and it was about collaboration nga, bilateral collaboration on COVID-19.

The photo used by The 16th President of The Philippines was taken by Agence France Presse’s Noel Celis at Duterte’s press conference at Malacanang on Jan. 30, 2017.





The Facebook page was created in August 2017. Its Trump-Duterte post has 1,200 likes, 545 comments and 440 shares.





One reader fixed the grammatical errors in Trump’s fabricated quote in his comment.

Correct. UK-based companies invested around $541 billion in the USA in 2017, based on official US figures. That made it the top investor in the country.

The UK is the largest investor in the US economy.

Correct, looking at the value of what each country exports in goods and services to the other. The total value of this in 2018 came to around £191 billion.

“Our nations have more than $1 trillion invested in each other’s economics. The United Kingdom is America’s largest foreign investor and our largest European export market.” Donald Trump, 4 June 2019

During their joint press conference during President Trump’s state visit to the UK, the President and the Prime Minister both spoke about foreign investment and trade between the United States and the UK. Both leaders’ claims were correct.

Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I’m in

A trading relationship

Mrs May said the UK-US trading relationship was worth over £190 billion per year. That’s correct if you look at the value of what each country exports to the other.

UK exports in goods and services to the US were worth around £118 billion in 2018 with US exports to the UK (or what we import) worth just over £72 billion. In total that’s trade worth around £191 billion to both the UK and the United States.

You could also express that in terms of the UK’s balance of trade (exports minus imports) which was worth just under £46 billion.

Mr Trump also said that the UK was the USA’s largest European export market. That’s correct. In 2018 exports to the UK made up almost 6% of all US exports, putting it behind Canada, Mexico and China, but ahead of all other countries the US exports to (including those in Europe).

Investing in the relationship

Both Mrs May and Mr Trump claimed that over $1 trillion was mutually invested in the two countries. The Prime Minister’s office told us this was based on US figures from the Bureau for Economic Affairs (BEA).

These show that the UK-based companies invested around $541 billion in the USA in 2017 while US-based companies invested around $748 billion in the UK. That totals around $1.3 trillion (which is slightly over £1 trillion).

Mr Trump also claimed that the UK is America’s largest foreign investor. That’s correct, according to the BEA figures. The $541 billion the UK invested in 2017 put it top for investment in the US ahead of Japan, Canada, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that year.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK are slightly different and put UK-based companies’ investment at around £258 billion in 2017 (or $330 billion based on that year’s exchange rate).

Mrs May expanded on this by claiming that the US was also the largest investor in the UK. That’s also correct, US-based companies invested around £351 billion in the UK ($450 billion). That makes it the top investor ahead of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Japan and Germany.

The ONS told us that it’s unclear exactly why their figures and those from the US differ so much, and say they’re undertaking work to find out more about this. We’ve run into this issue with trade figures before and written more about it here.","The UK and US invest $1tn between them in each other’s economies. UK-based companies invested around $541bn in the US in 2017 while US-based companies invested around $748bn in the UK, according to official US figures. That totals around $1.3tn. UK exports in goods and services to the US were worth around £118bn in 2018 with US exports to the UK (or what we import) worth just over £72bn. In total that’s trade worth around £191bn to both the UK and the United States."

Trump’s indictment was for state crimes.

Example video title will go here for this video

Former president Donald Trump has been indicted on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in the first degree, entering a plea of not guilty at his arraignment in New York on Tuesday.

Manhattan prosecutors accused Trump of illegally covering up a series of payments, some of which they allege were hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about an affair.

The charges do not prevent Trump from seeking or serving a second term in the White House; Trump formally kicked off a campaign for the 2024 presidential election last November.

Several VERIFY viewers asked us whether Trump could pardon himself if he is re-elected president in 2024.

THE QUESTION

Could Trump pardon himself in the New York case if he is elected president in 2024?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No, if he becomes president again, Donald Trump could not pardon himself of any of the state charges brought in New York. The Constitution only permits presidential pardons for federal crimes.

WHAT WE FOUND

The United States Constitution establishes the power of the president to issue pardons and commutations, which can, to varying degrees, reduce or wipe out the punishments of certain crimes.

Article II, Section 2 reads “The President… shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.”

The Supreme Court has ruled the president can pardon someone at any time after a crime has been committed, “either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.”

There are only two firmly established limits to how the president can use the pardon.

First, as stated above, it does not apply in “cases of impeachment” – meaning the president could not un-impeach someone, including themselves.

Second, the pardon only extends to “offenses against the United States” – meaning federal crimes. State crimes are considered offenses against that state. Each state has its own process for administering pardons, usually involving the governor and/or some sort of board.

Trump’s recent indictment was for state crimes, brought on behalf of the People of the State of New York. Trump is accused of breaking New York Penal Law § 175.10, falsifying business records in the first degree, 34 times. State law describes this as a class E felony, which is higher than a misdemeanor but lower than all other felony classes in the state. Each count carries a maximum prison term of four years, but convicts with no prior felony record can receive much lighter sentences, such as probation or a fine.

The prosecution is being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The district attorney is responsible for prosecuting state crimes in Manhattan; federal crimes in that area are prosecuted by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which is an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice.","Former President Donald Trump has been indicted on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in New York. Some VERIFY viewers asked if Trump could pardon himself if he is re-elected president in 2024. The answer is no, as the Constitution only permits presidential pardons for federal crimes, and Trump's indictment is for state crimes. The president's power to issue pardons and commutations is established in Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled that the president can pardon someone at any time after a crime has been committed.

Example video title will go here for this video

On April 4, Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump’s arraignment came roughly a week after a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict the former president.

In the time between Trump’s indictment and arraignment, a video clip of President Joe Biden garnered millions of views. In the video clip, Biden can be heard saying: “We’ll just have to demonstrate that he will not take power … if he does run, making sure he – under legitimate efforts of our Constitution – does not become the next president again.”

A video with more than 4 million views says: “And there it is - he said the quiet part out loud. Biden all but confirmed that his team is coordinating these Trump indictments to ‘stop Trump from taking power again.’”

And there it is - he said the quiet part out loud

THE QUESTION

Did Biden say his administration is using the indictment to ensure Trump does not become the next president?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No, Biden did not say his administration is using the indictment to ensure Trump does not become the next president. The video is old and being shared out of context.

WHAT WE FOUND

The video clip is real, but it is being shared out of context.

Biden made those comments on Nov. 9, 2022 during a press conference when he was answering questions ahead of his trip to Asia for the G-20 Summit. Reporters asked him about conversations he’d had with other world leaders about Trump’s plan to run for president in 2024.

VERIFY found the original video using InVid, a video forensics tool, and used RevEye to reverse image search individual frames from the clip.

NBC News was one news outlet that posted Biden’s full press conference on Nov. 9, 2022. The portion where Biden makes the statement shown in the viral post starts about 25 minutes into the press conference.

A reporter asks Biden: “The entire genesis of that conversation was tied to your predecessor [Trump], who is about to launch another campaign so how do you reassure them [other world leaders at the G20 Summit], if that is the reason for their questioning, that the former president will not return, that his political movement which is still very strong uh we'll now once again take power in the United States?”

Biden then says: “We’ll just have to demonstrate that he will not take power … if he does run, making sure he – under legitimate efforts of our Constitution – does not become the next president again.”

The Hill, a news outlet that covers politics and Washington D.C., also reported on Biden’s comments in November. C-SPAN also carried coverage of the press conference.

At the time, Trump had not yet announced he was running for president again -- Trump announced that on Nov. 16. He also had not yet been indicted in New York.

As of April 4, the White House has not made a public statement regarding Trump’s indictment.

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that “our focus right now is on the American people,” and was noncommittal when asked whether Biden was following the news.","An old video clip of President Joe Biden is being falsely used to claim that he admitted to coordinating Donald Trump's indictment to prevent him from taking power again. The clip is from a November 9, 2022, press conference, where Biden was asked about conversations with world leaders regarding Trump's potential 2024 presidential run. Biden's statement in the clip refers to ensuring Trump does not become president again through legitimate constitutional efforts, not through the indictment. The video is being shared out of context, and the White House has not made any public statements regarding Trump's indictment as of April 4."

Not Antifa

Is this man photographed storming the U.S. Capitol in fur and horns an antifa activist working to make supporters of President Donald Trump look bad? No, that's not true: The man in the photo is a well-known QAnon supporter who has been identified as Jake Angeli, nicknamed ""QAnon Shaman"" for his face paint, bare chest and tattoos. Angeli has given interviews to the press about his support of President Trump. The U.S. Justice Department, in a statement announcing his arrest on charges relating to the invasion, said his legal name is Jacob Anthony Chansley.

An example of the claim can be seen in a post (archived here) where it was published by Shawna Lambert on Facebook on January 6, 2021. It opened:

Media wants you to blame the unrest on Trump supporters. I'm not here to suggest there aren't Trump supports who stormed the Capitol - there are.

This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:

(Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Wed Jan 6 23:57:48 2021 UTC)

The entire post read:

Media wants you to blame the unrest on Trump supporters. I'm not here to suggest there aren't Trump supports who stormed the Capitol - there are.

However... if you think that everything is always as it appears, you are naive.

Incase you are blind and can't tell that these people are not Trump supporters, take a look again at the guy with the horns (and the pedo tattoo).

This is all political theater to cause division.

**Edit: yellow sweatshirt guy is Philly Antifa""

Chansley, a.k.a Angeli, was taken into federal custody, according to a news release from prosecutors on January 9, 2021:

Jacob Anthony Chansley, a.k.a. Jake Angeli, of Arizona, was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Chansley was taken into custody today. It is alleged that Chansley was identified as the man seen in media coverage who entered the Capitol building dressed in horns, a bearskin headdress, red, white and blue face paint, shirtless, and tan pants. This individual carried a spear, approximately 6 feet in length, with an American flag tied just below the blade.

Photographs by news photographers and by rioters carrying smartphones show Trump supporters storming the United States Capitol building while Congress was in joint session to conduct the ceremonial counting of Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. Several social media posts claimed the man in the picture was an antifascist activist with a pedophile tattoo and not an actual Trump supporter.

There is ample evidence that Angeli is a QAnon supporter.

Pro Trump attorney L. Lin Wood tweeted about Angeli storming the capitol, claiming he was not a Trump supporter.

Indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today to inflict harm & do damage. NOT @realDonaldTrump supporters.



Do not be fooled. Trump supporters are peaceful. It was antifa that created the violence in our cities over the past several months. pic.twitter.com/eGJmJwJvNq -- Lin Wood (@LLinWood) January 6, 2021

However, Angeli gave an interview to BrieAnna Frank, a reporter for Arizona Central, in May 2020, where he spoke of his beliefs:

""I think it is important that the president of the United States knows that his people support him.""

Frank posted the interview on Twitter:

I'm seeing false tweets that Jake Angeli (aka ""QAnon Shaman"") who was part of the group that stormed the Capitol and made it into the chamber, is Antifa.



He is very much a @realDonaldTrump and QAnon supporter, per my interview with him last year 👇@azcentral https://t.co/S8luSxeHiO -- BrieAnna J. Frank 🌵 (@brieannafrank) January 6, 2021



Yahoo News published an article on January 6, 2021 that identified Angeli. Titled, ""QAnon supporter from Arizona dressed in fur and horns joins storming of US Capitol,"" it called Angeli, ""a QAnon supporter who has been a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year.""



Arizona Central published an article in October 2020 titled, ""QAnon, false flags and baby-eating liberals: How Arizona Patriots build community around conspiracy theories,"" where Angeli was identified as a QAnon supporter.

U.S. correspondent for Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail reporter Adrian Morrow claimed he interviewed Angeli after he stormed the Capitol.

I spoke with Jake Angeli, the QAnon guy who got inside the Senate chamber. He said police eventually gave up trying to stop him and other Trump supporters, and let them in. After a while, he said police politely asked him to leave and let him go without arrest -- Adrian Morrow (@AdrianMorrow) January 6, 2021

Angeli's ""pedo tattoo"" appears to be a triple triangle Germanic valknut tattoo. The meaning is up for discussion but SF Critic identified the tattoo as having a connection to white nationalist groups.



Whether you're planning to get this as a memento mori or use it as a symbol for paganism, beware that because of its vague origins, you may be subject to misinterpretation which can cause anger and confusion from people who mistake your valknut for something else...some white nationalist groups have used the valknut to represent their heritage. And because of its vague symbolism, the German government does not treat their use of the valknut the same way some Nazis sport the swastika in public.""





Another set of images from the January 6, 2021, insurrection, a pair of images presented together, were being offered as proof that the people who stormed inside the capitol building included people associated with antifa. But the images don't prove anything.

One image from inside the capitol shows a bearded man with long hair wearing a yellow sweatshirt. In other photos his tattooed hands can be seen. The other image, apparently taken at another time and place, shows two men posing together, one man who has a similar appearance to the man in the yellow sweatshirt, is wearing an ""Exile Fitness"" T-Shirt. This second photo is a screen-grab that shows the URL 'phillyantifa.org' and the image dimension 618 x 340.

The URL for phillyantifa.org in one photo and the long beards of the men pictured seems to be the only connection offered that the man in the yellow sweatshirt is affiliated with antifa. The two men may not be the same person. Although the image did originate from phillyantifa.org (archived here), this is from a collection of photos they published identifying people associated with a white nationalist group called Keystone United. The man wearing the Exile Fitness shirt is identified in multiple photos on the phillyantifa.org website as Jason Tankersley.

The man in the yellow sweatshirt with the tattooed hands has not yet been identified but does not appear to be Jason Tankersley, based on comparison of the arch of his eyebrows and the growth pattern of his facial hair. Lead Stories was unable to locate any recent photos of Jason Tankersley's hands.

Below are three images of Jason Tankersley, and outlined in red is the unidentified man who was inside the Capitol.

The tattoo on the hand of the man in the yellow sweatshirt does not appear to be a hammer and sickle either, as several online posts are claiming, including this tweet from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas:

Please people; no violence. That only hurts our cause. Those leading the charge like the guy in yellow with the communist hammer & sickle tattoo: stopping the violence applies to you too. pic.twitter.com/XLKU9Y2y4x -- Louie Gohmert (@replouiegohmert) January 6, 2021

Instead it looks more like the ""Outsider's Mark"", a tattoo design that appears in the video game series Dishonored.

(Source: Dishonored wiki)

Tankersley posted a message on Facebook late on January 6, 2021.","A man photographed storming the U.S. Capitol in fur and horns is not an antifa activist, but a well-known QAnon supporter named Jake Angeli, also known as ""QAnon Shaman.""

And as reported by AFP, Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, a darling of conservatives for her religious views, to replace the late liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, potentially impacting some of the most partisan issues in America, from abortion to gun rights and health care.

Trump and Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden met on stage on September 29, 2020, for the first of three televised debates. AFP Fact Check unpacked some of the claims made during the debate.

A man was urinating on the wall built to hide the slums before US President Donald Trump’s visit.

Verification

Since US President Donald Trump is visiting India on 24-25 February, his visit has created a buzz on social media. Writer and Director Avinash Das, Aam Aadmi Party social media Incharge Aishwary Verma, Writer Santosh Addagulla and many others have shared a photo in which a man can be seen urinating on a wall that consists the paintings of US President Donald Trump and Indian PM Narendra Modi.

As we reverse searched the viral picture, we found that the man urinating on the wall is missing in the actual picture. The same image is posted by many websites.

India hastily builds wall along slum ahead of Trump visit Published: Tuesday, February 18, 2020 @ 8:09 AM Updated: Tuesday, February 18, 2020 @ 8:08 AM – A half-kilometer (1,640-foot) brick wall has been hastily erected in India’s Gujarat state ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, with critics saying it was built to block the view of a slum area inhabited by more than 2,000 people.

India hastily builds wall along slum ahead of Trump visit AHMEDABAD, India – (AP) – A half-kilometer (1,640-foot) brick wall has been hastily erected in India’s Gujarat state ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, with critics saying it was built to block the view of a slum area inhabited by more than 2,000 people.

The difference between the two images:

The key differences between the two images are:

The urinating man is missing in the original image. There is no shadow of urinating man in the edited image while the shadow of the tree is clearly visible. The edited image is zoomed and cropped hence the quality of the edited image has deteriorated (Generally, edited images are of low quality).

Now since it is proved in our investigation that the image shared by social media users is ‘Photoshopped’, we began our investigation to know more about the urinating man. At first, we reverse searched the cropped picture of the urinating man but we didn’t find any authentic information.

We searched Google with several combinations of keywords and we found that the picture is existing on the internet from a long time. We searched Google with the keyword ‘man urinating on a wall in India’, we found that the same image was shared by a satirical website namely ‘Faking News’ in January 2017.

As it is clear from their name, the website ‘Faking News’ is a satirical website and the content shared by them is for entertainment purposes only. However, it was evident from the date on which the Faking News article was published that the picture of urinating man is not related to Trump’s India visit in anyway.

Good citizen urinating only on walls that already smell of piss Urinating on public walls is an integral part of Indian culture. While people generally use any wall they see for urination, 26 yrs old Azad Singh makes sure that he urinates only on walls that are already smelling of piss.

Since the picture of urinating man on the wall in the edited picture is of low quality, the same picture is available in high quality in Faking News’ article. As we reverse searched it, we found that the same picture is used by multiple publishers between 2012 and present.

Amid multiple reports, we found a YouTube video uploaded by a channel namely ‘newsofdelhi’. The video was uploaded on 13 January 2012 with the title ‘Delhi Metro Walls have become the famous Peeing destination for Delhiites’.

Now we matched the screengrab from the above video and the picture of the urinating man from the claim and we found that the same man is present in both the images.

Similarities between the two images:

The cap is the same in both the images. The color of the sweater is the same in both the images. The color and positioning of the bag are the same in both the images. The color of the pant is the same in both the images.

It is evident from our investigation that the claim shared by Avinash Das, Aishwary Verma, Santosh Addagulla and others is ‘Misleading’ as image shared by them is ‘Photoshopped.’

Fact check: Viral image of Trump's pic as Hitler's moustache on Time magazine cover is false

Protests over the death of the African-American man George Floyd has been incinerating America the whole of last week. Even social media was brimming with remarks condemning the 'racist' incident that occurred in the USA.

Amdist this chaos, an image, claimed to be the cover of TIME magazine, is going viral on social media, especially Twitter. Not just in English, the image was shared rampantly in many other languages.

When searched with the hashtag #timemagazine, we can see the virality of the claim.

Fact Check:

The claim is FALSE.

The latest magazine cover can be seen at https://time.com/magazine/, as the magazine has dedicated the latest issue to the impact of the pandemic on the next generation.

The Time magazine hared some tips in an article 'How to Spot a Fake TIME Cover'.

Some of the tips are checking the logo, as most of the fake covers have the logo wrong. The border might be thinner or broader. In some cases, the images used covered the logo whereas the original never does that. The cover pages of TIME magazine are generally shared on the social media accounts of TIME, so that they can be verified.

A traditional area of conservative support, it was also among a range of claims that Donald Trump mentioned as he moved forward with his 2024 presidential run.

Recalling his time in office, the former president also mentioned negotiations with the Mexican government where he claimed he managed to secure thousands of Mexican soldiers to patrol the U.S. border.

At a recent event in South Carolina Donald Trump claimed that he negotiated 28,000 Mexican soldiers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. Inset, Trump at the New Hampshire Republican State Committee's Annual Meeting on January 28, 2023 in Salem, New Hampshire. Getty

The Claim

A YouTube video, posted on January 28, 2023, shows former president Donald Trump saying at a rally in South Carolina: ""Strongest border, by the way. How important is that? Strongest border in history. We built hundreds and hundreds of miles of wall, we got Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers free of charge, no cost, and we had the greatest border in history.""

The Facts

This is a figure that Trump has quoted before in reference to a trade and security agreement signed between the U.S. and Mexico in 2019.

The agreement states that ""Mexico will take unprecedented steps to-increase enforcement to curb irregular migration"" following threats by Trump to impose new tariffs on Mexican imports.

Mexico also agreed to what was known as the Remain in Mexico policy, which required asylum seekers to wait for their claims to be processed in Mexico rather than in the U.S.

At an April 2022 rally in Delaware, Ohio, Trump referenced both the border agreement and Remain in Mexico (erroneously as ""Stay in Mexico""), alleging to have demanded from the country's ""highest representative"" (under Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador) 28,000 troops.

Claiming to quote the Mexican representative, Trump said: ""'We're not gonna give you 28,000 soldiers for free'.

""I said 'Yes you are, because it's now Friday afternoon at one o'clock and on Monday morning at 8 o'clock in the morning I'm putting on a 25 percent tariff, all of the cars that you stole (from) our industry, stole 32 percent, every car that comes into the United States is going to have a tax or tariff of 25 percent.

""And every other product you sell into the United States will be tariffed at approximately 25 percent starting Monday morning at 8 o'clock.

""And he looked at me, he said, 'Sir, it would be an honor to have 28,000 soldiers on the border. It would be an honor to have Stay in freaking Mexico.""

Trump then went on to say that the U.S. government managed to retain the 28,000 soldiers for two years after the agreement.

The 2019 agreement did not set out figures detailing troop numbers along the border and stated that the majority would be deployed ""throughout Mexico, giving priority to its southern border"" with Guatemala.

In a report by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) think tank, which assessed the agreement, the White House reported that while 25,000 troops in a ""new national guard"" were created since the tariff agreement, 10,000 were positioned along the southern border of Mexico to Guatemala.

These figures were taken from a (since-deleted) 2019 White House press briefing.

An archived copy, quoting former Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, stated: ""In addition, since June, Mexico has deployed thousands of troops.

""They've created a new national guard within their country: 10,000 troops to the southern border; 15,000 troops to the northern border with the United States. Again, unprecedented support and cooperation with the government of Mexico.""

This latter figure was also quoted separately by the Mexican government; the head of the Mexican army Luis Cresencio Sandoval said it had deployed nearly 15,000 ""units"" towards the U.S. border, partly consistent with the statement from Morgan.

According to a report by Reuters dated June 25, 2019, Sandoval said there was ""a total deployment of 14,000, almost 15,000 units between the National Guard and the Army"" in the north of Mexico.

Sandoval said the southern Mexico-Guatemala border had a deployment of 6,500 troops, per the report. That would be a combined total of around 21,500 across the northern and southern Mexican borders.

MPI did not report that 28,000 troops were sent to Mexico's borders and Newsweek could not find any publicly available data which shows that many troops were deployed either.

It's possible that between 2019 and the end of Trump's presidency further troops may have been deployed to help guard the Mexican borders, putting the total at 28,000. But there is no clear, verifiable data to support that conclusion.

The number Trump has quoted isn't entirely consistent either. At a visit to the Otay Mesa Border Wall Site in San Diego, California, in September 2019, Trump put the figure at 27,000. ""As you know, right now they have 27,000 soldiers. So, in addition to the wall, we have the soldiers,"" Trump said.

Although not addressing the 28,000 claim directly, a 2022 article by Spanish language newspaper El Pais said that Mexican president Obrador had ""dismissed"" comments Trump made discussing the agreement.

""Mexico is being talked about more in the United States and it is important that we Mexicans know why. This year, there are going to be elections in the United States and both parties are trying to put Mexico in their topics of debate,"" Obrador said.

""We are not going to allow any party, or any candidate, to use Mexico as a piñata.""

Newsweek was also unable to find other government resources, either from the Mexican or U.S. government which show that a total of 28,000 soldiers was deployed. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was unable to provide data on this point.

In any case, until such evidence comes to light, this claim remains unverified.

Newsweek has contacted Trump's representatives, the White House, and the Mexican government for comment.

The Ruling

Unverified.

After Trump said he would impose tariffs on Mexican goods, the Mexican government agreed to expand migration enforcement.

Trump has since claimed that Mexico deployed 28,000 troops to this end.

Figures from the U.S. government from 2019 stated that Mexico sent 10,000 troops to its U.S. border, with another 15,000 sent to the country's southern border with Guatemala, a total of around 25,000.

But separate figures from the Mexican side said 6,500 were deployed to its Guatemalan border and nearly 15,000 to its U.S. border, a total of around 21,500.

As it stands, there is an inconsistency between the numbers cited by Trump, his former administration, and the Mexican government.

Based on the evidence it has seen so far, Newsweek currently rates the 28,000 figure as Unverified.

FACT CHECK BY Newsweek's Fact Check team","Former President Donald Trump claimed that he negotiated 28,000 Mexican soldiers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border during his time in office. This figure is related to a 2019 trade and security agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. However, the agreement did not specify troop numbers along the border. A Migration Policy Institute report stated that 10,000 troops were positioned along the southern border of Mexico to Guatemala, while 15,000 troops were sent to the northern border with the United States. The Mexican government also reported a deployment of 6,500 troops to its Guatemalan border and nearly 15,000 to its U.S. border, totaling around 21,500.

24,1327,"“There are complaints, and the complaints from the Republican Party – they are not from Trump – they are very robust. Rudolph Giuliani himself, the former mayor of New York, a respected lawyer, gave numerous indications of it.”",Rodrigo Constantino,2020-11-30T00:00:00Z,POLYGRAPH.info,polygraph.info,https://www.polygraph.info/a/factcheck-in-brazil-disputed-claims-spread-about-us-election-fraud/6742691.html,"In Brazil, Disputed Claims Spread About U.S. Election Fraud",2020-11-30T00:00:00Z,Misleading,"In Brazil, Disputed Claims Spread About U.S. Election FraudOn November 23, more than two weeks after news networks declared Democrat Joe Biden victor in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the U.S. government’s General Services Administration acknowledged Biden as the presumptive winner and approved the start of a transition. Despite a profusion of protests and unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, President Donald Trump himself accepted the transition call and said he would leave office if the Electoral College formally accepts the results.

The following day, Rodrigo Constantino, a conservative Brazilian commentator who lives in the U.S. and has a large social media following, nonetheless continued to dispute the election results on Opiniao no Ar (Opinion on Air), a program broadcast by Rede TV news network. During the broadcast, which had nearly 148,000 views on YouTube alone, Constantino made several false or unsubstantiated claims regarding voting machines, voter fraud and the involvement of Big Tech in swaying voters.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a Trump ally and one of the few world leaders who have not congratulated Biden. Bolsonaro’s sons have also spread disinformation about the U.S. election. Constantino is a critic of the political left in Brazil and a supporter of Bolsonaro, who has praised him publicly.

Polygraph.info examined three of Constantino’s assertions, all of which were also made by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is leading the Trump campaign’s legal efforts to challenge the election results.

Statement: “There is a lot of debate about Dominion, a company that has ties to the other one in Venezuela.”

When replying to a question from a viewer about machine-counting of ballots in the election, Constantino relied on widely circulated claims that several news outlets have already been debunked (here, here and here).

In mid-November, for example, the pro-Trump One America News Network (OANN) accused Dominion, a company that sells electronic voting hardware and software, including voting machines and tabulators, in the United States and Canada, of stealing “as many as 435,000 votes from President Trump to Joe Biden.” The network said its claim was based on “an unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research.”

Giuliani also has cited Dominion in his conspiracy claims, which were picked up by the president himself, who tweeted in all caps on November 12: “DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE.”

To be clear, some Dominion software did have issues during the election, although none of those issues apparently affected vote counts. As The New York Times reported, the company’s software “was used in only two of the five counties that had problems in Michigan and Georgia, and in every instance, there was a detailed explanation for what had happened.”

Nonetheless, Trump’s legal team brought up Dominion during a November 19 news conference. Lawyer Sidney Powell, who has since been dropped from the Trump team, ​stated that “the Dominion Voting Systems, the Smartmatic technology software, and the software that goes in other computerized voting systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez.”

That is false. Dominion and Smartmatic – the “other” company referenced by Constantino – are two different firms and competitors. Smartmatic does not own Dominion, as Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert at the OSET Institute, told The Associated Press.

Although Smartmatic’s founder was born in Venezuela, the company was founded in Florida in 2000. The company’s website states that it ""has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and abides by a stringent code of ethics that forbids the company to ever donate to any political campaigns of any kind.”

And while the site acknowledges that Smartmatic “did election projects in Venezuela from 2004 to 2017,” it also states that in 2017, Smartmatic “technology helped prove that the [Venezuelan] government was reporting false turnout numbers – so [it] blew the whistle on them – and stopped doing business there.”

On November 26, Dominion issued a statement disputing Powell’s accusations, calling them “baseless, senseless, physically impossible, and unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.” In regard to Venezuela, the statement said:

“Dominion has no ties to the Venezuelan government, nor any other foreign government, including China and Iran. Dominion has never participated in any elections in Venezuela and has no connection or relationship with the now deceased former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez. Other companies have serviced elections in Venezuela, but Dominion is not one of them.”

Statement: “There are complaints, and the complaints from the Republican Party – they are not from Trump – they are very robust. Rudolph Giuliani himself, the former mayor of New York, a respected lawyer, gave numerous indications of it.”

It’s a stretch to say the complaints from Giuliani and the Trump legal team are “not from Trump.” The president has repeated and amplified the claims numerous times on his Twitter account, which has nearly 89 million followers.

NBC News tracked down the status of 40 Trump legal challenges to the election in different states and reported that “most of them have been shot down or withdrawn, and no court has found even a single instance of fraud.”

On November 12, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement saying “the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” Trump subsequently fired the agency’s leader, Christopher Krebs, an act that prompted bipartisan criticism.

Statement: “And look, this question of voting by mail is suspicious. Votes that were submitted after hours and without matching signatures … and representatives of the Republican Party not being able access and observe [vote counting].”

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, many Americans preferred to vote by mail this year. With that in mind, many states expanded mail voting and related infrastructure. A record number of mail-in ballots – double those in the 2016 presidential voting – taxed the counting in some states.

Still, Constantino’s claims about late ballots and signatures are misleading.

Each state has specific rules regarding mail-in ballots, and most require them to be received by Election Day (November 3 in this case). More than a dozen states allow ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by November 3, even if they arrived afterward. Washington state, for example, allowed ballots received through November 23 to be counted.

Pennsylvania accepted mail-in ballots until November 6 if postmarked by Election Day. In light of that, the Pennsylvania secretary of state extended the deadline for providing missing proof of identification from November 9 to November 12.

That extension was challenged by the Trump campaign, and a state judge ordered election officials to segregate ballots with voter identification issues. On November 6, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ordered that ballots received after Election Day in Pennsylvania be segregated pending action by the full Supreme Court. The number of ballots in question isn’t enough to affect Biden’s win in the state.

Signature-matching has been an issue in previous elections. To verify their ballot is authentic, voters sign their ballot return envelope. These signatures are then compared (using computers and by hand) with those on file at elections offices. If they don’t match, ballots can be tossed out, or in some cases voters are given a chance to resolve any apparent differences.

Ballots normally do get rejected. According to Pew Research, nearly 33.5 million mail in ballots were submitted in the 2016 general election, and more than 400,000 (1.2 percent) weren’t counted. Of those, about 28 percent were disqualified because signatures didn’t match.

In the 2018 mid-term U.S. elections, almost 628,000 (2.1 percent) of the 30.2 million domestic civilian mail-in ballots submitted weren’t counted. Of those, 15 percent were dropped for non-matching signatures.

In Georgia, where Biden won by a narrow margin this year, a similar percentage of mail-in ballots were rejected because of signature issues. Citing the Georgia secretary of state’s office, FactCheck.org reported that as an overall percentage of all mail-in ballots cast, “the rejection rate for signature issues was nearly identical in 2020 (0.15%) to what it was in 2018 (0.16%).”

John C. Fortier, director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The New York Times the signature issues were minor: “There is [no] evidence that there is widespread fraud in any part of the system or absentee system, certainly not in the numbers of millions or nationwide.”

The Trump campaign’s claim of not being able to observe vote counts got little traction.

A judge in Michigan rejected a Trump campaign legal challenge asking that the counting and processing of absentee ballots be halted until “inspectors” from both parties could be physically present at absentee counting boards, and that the Michigan secretary of state order the segregation of all ballots not being inspected and monitored.

In Detroit, according to a Reuters fact check, “Republican and Democrat challengers were allowed inside the room but people from both sides were blocked from re-entering because maximum capacity had been reached.”

In Pennsylvania, Trump campaign lawyers argued in court that observers had been given insufficient access to the vote count. But then, one of the lawyers conceded there had been a “nonzero number of people in the room.” The judge in the case replied: “I'm sorry, then what's your problem?"" The Trump campaign’s complaint was rejected.

Philadelphia City Commissioners set up a live web stream so anyone could watch the vote count online. And a judge rejected a Nevada Republican lawsuit which claimed that more than 3,000 inel","Brazilian commentator Rodrigo Constantino made several false or unsubstantiated claims regarding voting machines, voter fraud and the involvement of Big Tech in swaying voters.

We counted at least eight faulty claims in less than five minutes.

In the interview that aired May 24, Trump lauded his administration’s efforts at the border, criticized the diversity visa program, and called out policies that he believes threaten the nation’s security.

Here’s what Trump said, fact-checked.

‘(The diversity visa) lottery is ridiculous, as you know. They take people from a lottery where you can imagine these countries are not putting their finest in that lottery.’

That’s Pants on Fire. Trump again mischaracterizes the diversity visa program that lets in about 50,000 immigrants per fiscal year.

Countries do not send immigrants; individual make the decision to apply for the lottery, and simply applying doesn’t guarantee they’ll come to the United States.

Applicants must meet work or education requirements and be thoroughly vetted by the U.S. State Department before their arrival.

‘You look at what's going on where somebody comes in who's bad, and yet they'll have 24 members of a family, not one of them do you want in this country.’

Trump revived an earlier False claim that ""22 to 24 people"" came to the United States due to family ties with the suspect in an October 2017 New York City terror attack.

Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security have provided information to substantiate Trump’s claims. Immigration experts previously told us Trump’s ""chain migration"" numbers are unlikely, particularly because there are limitations on who can be sponsored for immigration.

A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members.

‘You catch them, even if you know they are a criminal, you catch them, you have to release them, by law. You have to release them.’

Trump leaves out important context. ""Catch and release"" is not a law, but a practice generally used in cases dealing with unaccompanied minors and asylum seekers. It is not reserved for criminals.

Some immigrants who have been apprehended or who presented themselves at the border are released into the country with the expectation that they will come back before an immigration judge.

In a February 2017 memo, then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (now White House chief of staff) said detention of all immigrants may not be possible due to limited detention space.

""Detention resources should be prioritized based upon potential danger and risk of flight if an individual alien is not detained, and parole determinations will be made in accordance with current regulations and guidance,"" Kelly said.

‘We have the worst immigration laws in the entire world by far. Other countries laugh at us, and it’s because of the Democrats. It’s because of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.’

Trump consistently has criticized U.S. immigration laws and has called them ""pathetic"" compared to Mexico’s policies. But we’ve found that Trump underplays the increasing robustness of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement, and also has downplayed Mexico’s own porous southern border. We rated that off-base comparison between the United States and Mexico as Mostly False.

Trump has also falsely claimed that the ""catch-and-release"" practice stems from Democrats. It dates back to at least Republican President George W. Bush, and continues under Trump’s Republican leadership.

On MS-13 gang members: ‘We are bringing them out by the thousands’

That’s Mostly False. Immigration officials say they don’t have a count of how many MS-13 gang members have been deported, since they don’t break down deportation data by gang affiliation.

While thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump’s administration, there’s no number indicating they all belonged to MS-13. Law enforcement officials estimate there are about 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The membership includes U.S. citizens who can’t be deported.

‘The Democrats are sticking up for MS-13, you heard Nancy Pelosi the other day, like trying to find all sorts of reasons why they should be able to stay’

Trump repeats his False claim about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi coming out in favor of MS-13 gang members and defending them.

The claim stems from Pelosi’s criticism of Trump for using the word ""animals"" during an immigration meeting with California officials. Trump used that term after a sheriff spoke about MS-13 gang members.

A day after Trump’s comment, Pelosi said ""calling people animals is not a good thing"" and defended ""undocumented immigrants."" She did not bring up MS-13 gang members in her comments.

‘We do have $1.6 billion, as you know we started the wall.’

This is disingenuous and Mostly False. Congress appropriated $1.6 billion to replace existing border fencing and add some new barriers. But the money cannot be used to build any of the wall prototypes built under Trump’s directive.

While there are border security improvements underway, Trump’s promised border wall is not under construction.

Illegal crossing over ‘the border is down over 40 percent.’

This is False. Even though Trump and Vice President Mike Pence say illegal border crossings are down 40 percent, official data does not support their claim.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection numbers shows that southwest border apprehensions increased from March to April of 2018; and the data for April 2018 is also higher than that of April of 2017 and 2016.

Apprehensions dropped 25 percent in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016.

Based on the most recent data, it’s unclear how Trump or Pence arrive at a 40 percent decline (and Trump has simultaneously bemoaned a recent rise in apprehensions).",President Donald Trump repeated several misleading talking points about immigration during an interview with Fox & Friends’ Brian Kilmeade.

Look for potential red flags

This video was posted by an account called “Millennial,” which has more than 100,000 subscribers. But glancing over the other videos they’ve posted, it’s clear the channel as a whole is focused mostly on comedy videos, not hard news.

There is also no added context in the description. Ideally, there would be a link to a credible source, or at least a credit to who took the video.

Another thing that stands out is that none of the people in the video are wearing masks. And while there were a lot of maskless people photographed at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — the fact that none of the police officers are masked up is a clue that this video could be old.

This tool is super, super helpful for a number of reasons. It can reveal added context, which is always a good thing. But it can also be used to determine if a video is just old, which wound up being the case for this video.

The verification tool led us to this 2017 video from C-SPAN. The video is titled, “Protesters at health care hearing: ‘No cuts to Medicaid, save our liberty.’” This is what the protesters are actually chanting in the YouTube video.

When it comes to verifying information, you always want to check multiple sources. And a keyword search of “disabled trump supporters capitol,” brought up several, reliable sources, including fact checks from Reuters and PolitiFact.

According to PolitiFact, yes — the footage is authentic. But what this video really shows is a demonstration from September 2017, when the U.S. Capitol police arrested 181 people outside a hearing room where U.S. senators were discussing a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Why we fact checked this: US President Donald Trump made this claim during the 3rd US presidential debate.

Complete details:

The US supposedly saw the “best” carbon emission numbers in 35 years under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Trump made this claim during the 3rd 2020 US presidential debate on Friday, October 23 (Philippine time).

In response to a question on how he plans on combatting climate change and support job growth, he said: “We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time…and we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration. We are working so well with industry.”

This lacks context.

US carbon emissions did decline during the Trump administration, but they were already declining since 2015. Trump has also been rolling back Obama-era climate policies that experts say could negatively affect the country’s carbon emissions in the coming years.

The lowest number in US carbon emissions did not happen during the Trump administration. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) report titled “Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks,” published on April 13, the lowest gross US greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2018 is 6,373 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e). This number was achieved in 1991.

The next lowest gross greenhouse gas emission numbers during that time period were achieved in 1990 and 1992 at 6,437 MTCO2e and 6,480 MTCO2e, respectively.

After those 3, the next lowest number is 6,488 MTCO2e, which was achieved in 2017. However, the numbers were already declining since 2015. The amount of carbon emissions also increased in 2018.

Moreover, Trump has been rolling back climate policies, which could negatively affect the US’ greenhouse gas numbers in the coming years, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider. Rhodium’s energy and climate team analyzes the market impact of energy and climate policy and the economic risks of climate change.

In a report published on September 17, Rhodium predicted that the total US emissions in 2035 will be 3% higher than they would have been without Trump’s rollbacks. – Vernise Tantuco/Rappler.com

Claim: The intelligence community ""secretly eliminated"" a requirement that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings, allowing the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine to be filed. Rating: About this rating False

In September 2019, whistleblower allegations that U.S. President Donald Trump held back military aid to Ukraine in an effort to obtain damaging information on a political rival led to an impeachment inquiry and an ongoing scandal.

It wouldn't be the 2010s if the fallout didn't include a conspiracy theory circulating in the right-wing media ecosystem. In this case, the conspiracy theory was given a major platform in the form of a tweet by Trump that his supporters widely shared:

WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019



The claim originated on The Federalist website, which published a story on Sept. 27 that was not only inaccurate but played on the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory, an idea now popular among both fringe fanatics and White House officials alike. It posits that U.S. intelligence agencies are scheming against Trump.

The Federalist story implied that the intelligence community changed existing rules so that the ""anti-Trump complaint"" could be filed on Aug. 12 using secondhand information. ""Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings,"" The Federalist reported.

The Federalist story included purported screenshots of previous and current versions of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form. The current form allows the whistleblower to check a box indicating that the person either learned of the information firsthand or from others, whereas the previous form contained the following language: But as Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, pointed out, even the previous version shown above doesn't say there was a “requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.” The law has never required them to do so.

Sanchez pointed out that the form pictured above contains a ""description of the Inspector General’s (IG) standard for making a credibility determination, as required by statute, within 14 days of the submission of a complaint. According to that guidance, the IG would not make a finding of credibility, and thus transmit the complaint to the [Director of National Intelligence], unless the DNI was in possession of direct evidence supporting the claim.""

It does not say, Sanchez continued, ""that whistleblowers may not submit reports based on secondhand knowledge, but rather that such reports will not be escalated to the DNI unless the IG can obtain more.""

The Intelligence Community Inspector General's Office (ICIG) was forced to issue a statement on Sept. 30 correcting the record. The statement read, in part:

The Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018, which went into effect before Inspector General [Michael] Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 29, 2018, following his swearing in as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 17, 2018. Although the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute. In fact, by law the Complainant – or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees – need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern. The ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law. Since Inspector General Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, the ICIG has not rejected the filing of an alleged urgent concern due to a whistleblower’s lack of first-hand knowledge of the allegations.

In other words, the entire premise of The Federalist story is wrong. No requirement exists that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrong-doings, and changing the rules would have required an act of Congress.

Tom Devine, legal director for the watchdog non-profit Government Accountability Project, called The Federalist story a ""shameless legal bluff.""

""No bureaucrat has the lawful authority to change the rules of the game for whistleblower rights,"" Devine told us. ""Not even the president can change that unilaterally.""

So how did the claim come about? It's true that the wording on an explanatory form for whistleblowers was changed, but the rules were not. The ICIG's statement notes that the wording was revised because ""certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.""

Devine added that government whistleblowers who report allegations of wrongdoing based on hearsay are still valuable resources in ferreting out government waste, corruption, and wrongdoing.

""If we restricted all credible government investigations to those with whistleblowers who have firsthand information, we'd cancel out 90% of law enforcement activity,"" Devine said. ""Whistleblower investigations are routinely based on hearsay.""

The ICIG's Sept. 30 statement additionally noted that the whistleblower's complaint did not contain only secondhand, ""unsubstantiated assertions."" The whistleblower ""checked two relevant boxes: The first box stated that, 'I have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved'; and the second box stated that, 'Other employees have told me about events or records involved.'""

In summary, the ICIG statement said:","The claim that the US intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement for whistleblowers to provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings is false. The conspiracy theory originated on The Federalist website and was later tweeted by President Trump. The Federalist story suggested that the intelligence community changed existing rules so that the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine could be filed using secondhand information. However, the law has never required whistleblowers to provide direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. The Intelligence Community Inspector General's Office (ICIG) issued a statement on September 30 correcting the record, stating that no such requirement exists and changing the rules would have required an act of Congress."

The Claim

The photo has been shared by multiple users. The Archived version of the post can be seen here and here. A snapshot is given below.

Fact Check

What is Delta Variant?

Delta variant is a mutated (evolved) variant of the original Novel Cornavirus.

As World Health Organization (WHO) explains on its website, “All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – evolve over time. When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a virus. These changes are called “mutations”. A virus with one or more new mutations is referred to as a “variant” of the original virus.”

WHO has termed the Delta variant as a “variant of concern” because of its increased transmissibility.

Did Donald Trump hold up the sign declaring Delta variant as Fake?

No. The image is altered.

Any such event by the former US President will be widely covered by the media. We checked and found no such reports in recent past.

A Google Reverse Image search helped us track down the original photo. It was from a 2017 event reports of which along with the photos can be seen here and here.

31,3795,"Andrew Johnson then, like Donald Trump now, was unjustly impeached by a group of radicals in the House of Representatives.",Robert Ray,2020-01-27T00:00:00Z,The Conversation,theconversation.com,https://theconversation.com/4-myths-the-trump-team-promoted-about-andrew-johnson-130752,4 myths the Trump team promoted about Andrew Johnson,2020-01-30T00:00:00Z,Misleading,"4 myths the Trump team promoted about Andrew JohnsonThe claims: Andrew Johnson then, like Donald Trump now, was unjustly impeached by a group of radicals in the House of Representatives.

Fortunately – so the claim continues – enough honest and brave men withstood forces in their own party and voted against convicting Johnson in the Senate. Among those was Sen. Edmund Ross of Kansas, the prototype for the “profile in courage” still recounted on the official website of the U.S. Senate.

These are falsehoods, and they have become a staple of Republican arguments opposing the impeachment of Trump. Regurgitating myths about Johnson and impeachment, Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s lawyers Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray have resurrected for the nation distortions long since buried by the last two generations of historians.

As a historian who for 30 years has researched and taught the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era and Southern history more generally, I’d like to discuss here four misuses of history from Trump’s attorneys.

1. Andrew Johnson was not railroaded by a radical minority bent on revenge.

“Then as now, a political faction has forced a partisan impeachment through the House in the heat of an argument over a difference in policy,” wrote Pence in an opinion article for the Wall Street Journal.

In the months following the Civil War, Johnson tried to put in place his own vision of Reconstruction – one in which ex-Confederates could easily win their way back to political power through the presidential power of the pardon, and one in which black people would have minimal rights under the draconian “Black Codes” of individual states.

The result was a disaster. Quickly reconstituted Southern state governments tried to recreate systems as close to slavery as possible. White supremacist mobs forcibly repressed black political activity, as seen in major “race riots” – white massacres of black people – in 1866. Meanwhile, Johnson frequently expressed his determination to maintain the United States as a white man’s country.

Congressional Republicans, who had initially thought Johnson might be their ally – since he had been an anti-secessionist senator from Tennessee prior to the war – were shocked. They became determined to regain control of Reconstruction once Congress was back in session in late 1865, and to ensure at least some measure of civil rights for black Americans. During the impeachment hearings, 45 of the 54 senators were Republican.

2. The ‘Radical Republicans’ were not radical.

The “Radical” Republicans – one particular important faction within the Republican Party as a whole – gained their name from their enemies in the 19th century, who tried to portray them as dangerous to American democracy.

The so-called Radicals pursued some recognition of the basic results of the Civil War and emancipation. This included creating the Freedmen’s Bureau, passing the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 and eventually putting into the Constitution the 14th and 15th Amendments, guaranteeing equality of citizenship and suffrage rights.

Ironically, it was Johnson’s unbending opposition to any measure to recognize black citizenship and civil rights, his incoherent and slanderous rhetoric on the stump, and his attempts to use presidential authority to defy congressional will and federal law that helped unify Republicans around key segments of the “Radical” program.

3. Edmund G. Ross was not a profile in courage.

In Ray’s arguments, he says that “President Johnson was saved from removal in office by one vote, and thus by one courageous senator.”

However, as numerous historians, including specialists such as David O. Stewart and Deborah Wineapple, have documented, Kansas Sen. Edmund G. Ross was for impeachment before he was against it.

He turned against it in part because he leveraged it to obtain numerous political favors. This included the appointment of his corrupt Kansas sponsor Perry Fuller as chief collector of revenue in New Orleans. (Fuller then used his post to pile up US$3 million for himself.) Ross very possibly received direct cash as well, from a storehouse of cash Johnson’s supporters had raised to dispense such favors, although that cannot be proven beyond a doubt.

Ross was no hero from central casting. That role might better be given to Thaddeus Stevens, one of the House impeachment managers. Stevens lay, quite literally, on his deathbed as he was carted into the Senate during the weeks of the trial, trying to see through his vision of creating a more democratic and less racist American republic.

4. Andrew Johnson was not impeached just for a technical violation of a congressional act.

Ray also said of Democrats that “they now argue that President Andrew Johnson’s impeachment from over 150 years ago, following the end of the Civil War and during Reconstruction, was not about a violation of the Tenure of Office Act – which after all was the violation of law charged as the principle article of impeachment – but instead rested on his use of power with illegitimate motives.”

There were 11 impeachment articles against Johnson. Several recounted his violation of the Tenure of Office Act, when Johnson tried to fire Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, originally a Lincoln appointee.

But more generally, the articles, particularly the final one, recounted Johnson’s conduct in office, his disgracing of the presidency and his fight to thwart the clear will of Congress in creating the new fundamental legal structure of the American Republic, and of resisting the enforcement of African American rights.

In his oration on Monday, Ray mentioned that delving into history was always a “treacherous endeavor for lawyers.” Indeed it is – especially when said lawyers parrot long-discredited myths in defending their present client.

The president’s comments contradict what both he and Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said in the past. During the April 13 coronavirus task force press briefing, Trump was asked if he and Fauci were “on the same page.” He responded: “Yeah, we have been from the beginning.” At the same press briefing, Fauci discussed how responsive Trump was to the recommendations made by the task force. After discussing the recommendations they made regarding mitigation, Fauci mentioned: “The travel [restriction] was another recommendation, when we went in and said, ‘We probably should be doing that.’ And the answer was ‘yes.’ And then another time was, ‘We should do it with Europe,’ and the answer was ‘yes.’ And the next time, ‘We should do it with the U.K.,’ and the answer was ‘yes.’”

While Fauci said in the earlier stages of the pandemic that a China travel ban was “not something that I think we’re even considering,” according to New York Times interviews with White House aides and Fauci himself, by January 30 the leading public health officials in the federal government were recommending travel restrictions with China to President Trump. Aides also told the Wall Street Journal that it was Fauci, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that convinced the initially- skeptical Trump to make the decision. Azar’s explanation of the decision echoes this reporting, as he said the travel restrictions were implemented based on “the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”

Fauci supported the travel restrictions with China publicly as well. At the task force press briefing on the day the restrictions were announced, Fauci said that “because there are so many unknowns here, we’re going to take the action that the secretary will describe [restricting travel from China], in a temporary way, to make sure we mitigate, as best as we possibly can, this risk.”","President Trump claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci disagreed with his decision to close the border to China, but later agreed and said it saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Donald Trump celebrated his decision to roll back regulations on environmental protections, health care and other industries by posing next to this stack of papers meant to represent the regulations he was ditching.

A Facebook post published on January 16 claimed that former US president Donald Trump was about to declassify a large number of documents, with the aim of “revealing them to the world”. The post, which includes a photo of the president posing next to tall stacks of paper, was shared more than a thousand times the day before his successor Joe Biden took office. Turns out, however, this photo is old and has nothing to do with classified documents.

The photo shows a smiling Trump posing next to several stacks of paper. One towering series of piles is labeled “Today” while the other, much shorter stack is labelled ""1960"". The caption claims that Trump is getting ready to declassify all of the documents in the “Today” stacks.

“Files that will be declassified and revealed to the world,” says the caption, claiming that Trump is planning to reveal state secrets before leaving the Oval Office.

We ran this photo through a reverse image search on Google (take a look here to find out how), which pulled up photos of the same scene published by various media outlets. Turns out, the photo isn’t recent: it was taken at the White House on December 14, 2017 during a press event.

The stacks of papers aren’t documents declassified by Trump. They are actually meant to represent regulations. On that day, Trump’s team set up this exhibit to demonstrate what they saw as the need to simplify – and some cases throw out – these laws.

“We have decades of excess regulation to remove,” Trump stated during the event.

In the Washington Post video below, the president says that he will make the “Today” pile even smaller than the “1960” pile by the end of his time in office. He then cuts a red ribbon strung across the two piles.

The piles of paper are meant to represent the number of pages of regulations in 1960 and 2017, respectively. Trump said, at the event, that there were 20,000 pages of regulation in 1960 and 185,000 pages in 2017. However, The Washington Post was sceptical and determined that the stacks at the event were too high and must have contained many more papers than those figures.","A Facebook post from January 16 claimed that former US President Donald Trump was about to declassify a large number of documents, with a photo of him posing next to tall stacks of paper.

The ad portrays Booker's accomplishments as overshadowed by the other former mayor and Rhodes scholar in the race - South Bend, Ind.'s Pete Buttigieg, whose credential as a Rhodes scholar has been cited more often, according to a November 2019 analysis by the Huffington Post.

There are three main details we'll check.

First, Booker was in fact awarded the prestigious international Rhodes scholar fellowship in 1992, according to a Rhodes scholar database by Rhodes Trust.

A news release from the Association of American Rhodes Scholars points out Booker is a 'graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, and attended the University of Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship.”

We are not analyzing whether Booker 'has what it takes to beat Donald Trump.”

On the claim of criminal justice reform passing a Republican Senate, Philip Swibinski, of United We Win, said this refers to the First Step Act, a 'landmark piece of legislation that Booker sponsored and championed.” He referred to a news release from Booker's Senate website.

The First Step Act relaxed certain mandatory minimum sentencing rules, placed inmates in facilities closer to home, provided relief for non-violent offenders and outlined incentives for completing recidivism-reducing programs, among other changes, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

When the bill was signed into law in December 2018, the Republicans had a 51-47 majority in the Senate, according to the U.S. Senate website. Booker was a co-sponsor of the bill and was cited in media reports as 'central to the bill's passage.”

The last claim - that Booker made Newark schools No. 1 for beating the odds - is more complicated.

One, 'beating the odds” is an ambiguous phrase. Second, municipal governments typically don't have oversight of school systems, which warrants additional scrutiny of why Booker should get credit.

The Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington describes 'beating the odds” - as do several other organizations - as a measure showing 'the average share of students in a city enrolled in a school whose proficiency rates outpaced demographically similar schools elsewhere in the state.”

Based on a three-year analysis conducted by the center, Newark was 'beating the odds” at the highest rate in the nation. That is to say, the portion of students scoring at or above proficiency - beyond what models would predict based on local and statewide school demographics - was the highest in the nation.

But does Booker get to take credit for it?

By the time Booker took office - he served as mayor of Newark for seven years, 2006-13 - the state had been running Newark's long-failing, corruption-prone schools for 11 years with little improvement.

Booker, who long had championed education reform and options beyond traditional schools, helped persuade Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to pledge up to $100 million in matching funds and solicited numerous other multimillion-dollar contributions to his school reform plan, which focused on charter schools.

Charter schools receive public money but operate independently of the public school system. In New Jersey, they can be for-profit or nonprofit operations.

Booker presented the plan to then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, who joined the effort. The plan included closing low-performing schools and tying teacher pay to student performance, according to a report by Vox.

The partnership and reform efforts were examined extensively in Dale Russakoff's book, 'The Prize.”

On Booker's watch, municipal policies supported the charter school movement, including 'bringing to life a downtown complex that featured affordable housing for teachers and space for three charter schools,” according to a report about Booker's legacy of spreading charter schools in Newark in Chalkbeat, a website for education reporting.

The wisdom and success of charter schools is still debated. NorthJersey.com published an extensive investigation about how investors and developers are cashing in on charter schools, which have little public oversight, on the backs of taxpayers.

Nonetheless, that doesn't directly relate to the claim at hand. Newark's public schools returned from state to local control in 2018 with a graduation rate of 78 percent, a 27-point rise from 2011, according to NJ.com

Conclusion

The measurable claims in the United We Stand ad about Booker check out. He was a Rhodes scholar, and the ad fairly states Booker's role in the passage of criminal justice reform with bipartisan legislation in a Republican-controlled Senate. While questions linger about the charter school strategy in New Jersey, the ad fairly credits Booker for his role in the sweeping changes, which include students now outperforming expectations at the highest rate in the nation, according to one analysis.

Epstein, a financier and sex offender who was found dead in a New York prison cell last August, has been linked to the US president in a number of conspiracy theories that have been shared on social media since his death.

This particular image is one of the many false memes, photographs and articles connecting the two.

One version of the photograph that has been posted on Facebook in recent days has been shared 475 times, while another has been shared more than 100 times.

The photograph is a fake. It is a doctored version of a photograph from the 1990s which clearly shows Donald Trump with his daughter Ivanka.

In the false image, you can see part of Ivanka’s hair flowing down the left hand side of Epstein’s face.

The original image can be seen here.

Jeffrey Epstein did have some connections to Donald Trump – the two were social acquaintances, and Trump told a journalist in 2002 that Epstein was “terrific” and that “he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

However, whatever connections the two had, this photograph is not one of them.

There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus. Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you’re seeing – especially on WhatsApp – are true or not.

STOP, THINK AND CHECK

Look at where it’s coming from. Is it someone you know? Do they have a source for the information (e.g. the HSE website) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages from ‘a friend’ of theirs. Have a look yourself – do a quick Google search and see if the information is being reported elsewhere.

Secondly, get the whole story, not just a headline. A lot of these messages have got vague information (“all the doctors at this hospital are panicking”) and don’t mention specific details. This is often – but not always a sign – that it may not be accurate.

Finally, see how you feel after reading it. A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked. They’re deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it. If you feel panicked after reading something, check it out and see if it really is true.

Here’s a fact check of his remarks.

What President Trump Said

“And then Schiff went up and he got, as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place. He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is when he looked at the sheet — which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this — exact, word for word, he said, ‘Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong.’ So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said.”

False.

For days, Mr. Trump has criticized statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.

The president, who often misquotes others, has repeatedly accused Mr. Schiff of “treason” and committing a “crime” for the way he presented the call. He escalated those attacks by claiming, without evidence, that Mr. Schiff had decided to fabricate the conversation after realizing that Mr. Trump “didn’t do anything wrong.”

Mr. Schiff did not claim to be reciting from a reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring “the essence” of the conversation. But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump. Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his “summary of the president’s call was meant to be at least part in parody.”","President Trump has criticized statements made by Representative Adam B.

Let’s take stock of the outlandish claims from the Trump administration that have piled up over the past week, as a caravan of more than 5,000 migrants from Central America began its journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Thousands of people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have sought refuge in the United States during both the Obama and Trump administrations, fleeing gang violence and poverty in their home countries. This exodus has been going on since 2014.

Journalists on the ground say many migrants caught wind of this latest caravan via messaging apps, viral posts on social media and TV news reports before deciding to join. In Honduras, where the group originated, the poverty rate was 60.9 percent in 2016, according to the World Bank. The country had one of the highest murder rates in the world in 2017, 43.6 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the Observatory of Violence at the National Autonomous University of Honduras.

No matter. President Trump and his administration — not exactly known for their record of truth-telling on immigration — have set the spin machine to full blast. The caravan might have been orchestrated by Democrats or Venezuela, they say. It includes criminals, or MS-13 gang members, or possible terrorists, or people of (gasp!) Middle Eastern descent, they add.

So here we are again, fact-checking a bunch of phony claims about immigration.

The Facts

Trump had been grousing about the caravan for days, but a segment on “Fox & Friends” seems to have stuck with him. On Oct. 22, the caravan was featured around breakfast time.

“They are a threat to our national security because today, war — it’s not only countries that go to war, it is groups such as ISIS, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and they have declared war openly against the United States,” a commentator said. “So, with the open-borders policies we have had, how many of them are in America?”

Half an hour later, as the New York Times noted, Trump began fuming on Twitter. We’re going to round up some of the claims that he and other administration officials have made about the caravan.

“You have some very tough criminal elements within the caravan. But I will seal off the border before they come into this country, and I’ll bring out our military, not our reserves. I’ll bring out our military.” (Trump remarks to reporters, Oct. 20)

“Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy [sic]. Must change laws!” (Trump tweet, Oct. 22)

“Go into the middle of the caravan, take your cameras and search. Okay? Search. . . . You’re going to find MS-13, you’re going to find Middle Eastern, you’re going to find everything.” (Trump remarks to reporters, Oct. 22)

The Trump administration has provided no evidence that criminals, members of the MS-13 gang or people of Middle Eastern descent form part of the caravan. Trump has been criticized for profiling people of Middle Eastern descent with these remarks.

It’s also unclear whether the military could be deployed to stop border crossings. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama sent the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to provide technical or administrative help, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found, but deploying members of the Armed Forces might not be so easy.

“The use of the military to enforce immigration or criminal laws at the border could run afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, unless an exception applies,” according to a CRS report from April 2018.

“Absolutely. We have [evidence], and we know that this is a continuing problem. It’s not just in this. We have 10 individuals, suspected or known terrorists, that try to enter our country illegally every day.” (White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, in remarks to reporters, Oct. 22)

“In the last fiscal year we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as ‘other than Mexico’ ― that means from the Middle East region.” (Vice President Pence, in a live interview with The Washington Post, Oct. 23)

Sanders implied that 10 suspected or known terrorists are apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border every day. Pence took things further the next day, stating as fact that 10 suspected or known terrorists from the Middle East are apprehended daily.

Pence added that it was “inconceivable that there are not people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than 7,000 people advancing toward our border.”

As our colleague Aaron Blake of The Fix found, this is a spurious statistic.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in June that “on average, my department now blocks 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from traveling to or attempting to enter the United States.” That covers all ports of entry: airports, maritime ports, and the land borders with Canada and Mexico. Almost all suspected or known terrorists are apprehended at airports.

Advertisement

Trump’s own State Department, in a report issued in July 2017, found “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.”

The Department of Homeland Security on Oct. 22 told reporters that in fiscal 2018, Customs and Border Patrol agents “apprehended 17,256 criminals, 1,019 gang members, and 3,028 special interest aliens from countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Somalia.” None of those countries is in the Middle East. These figures do not cover the migrants in the current caravan or whether any of them are suspected or known terrorists.

“From a security standpoint, there is no proper accounting of who these individuals in the caravan are,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a briefing Oct. 23. “And this poses an unacceptable security risk to the United States.”

Advertisement

Notice how Pompeo is in sync with Trump in describing the caravan as a risk but doesn’t go so far as to say whether any members of the caravan are terrorists, criminals or people of Middle Eastern descent.

“.@DHSgov can confirm that there are individuals within the caravan who are gang members or have significant criminal histories.”

“Citizens of countries outside Central America, including countries in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S.”

“Stopping the caravan is not just about national security or preventing crime, it is also about national sovereignty and the rule of law. Those who seek to come to America must do so the right and legal way.” (tweets by DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton, Oct. 23)

“Department of Homeland Security says people from the Middle East, Africa, South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S.” (Sanders tweet, Oct. 23)

This is an artful sequence of tweets. Although Houlton said DHS “can confirm” that some people in the caravan “are gang members or have significant criminal histories,” once again, we ran into the brick wall of no evidence. “We cannot discuss or share data or information that is law enforcement sensitive,” a DHS official said.

The next tweet says people from all over the world are traveling through Mexico toward the United States. That’s accurate because Mexico has international flights that go north and travelers at the border. Nothing in this second tweet says people from “the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and elsewhere” are in the caravan.

The third tweet urges people to “come to America” in “the right and legal way.” U.S. law says “any alien who is physically present in the United States . . . whether or not at a designated port of arrival” may apply for asylum.

""They [Democrats] wanted that caravan, and there are those that say that caravan didn’t just happen, it didn’t just happen.” (Trump, rally in Montana, Oct. 18)

“Do you know how the caravan started? Does everybody know what this means? I think the Democrats had something to do with it.” (Trump, rally in Houston, Oct. 22)

""At the president’s direction, I spoke to President [Juan Orlando] Hernández of Honduras. He told me that the caravan that’s now making its way through Mexico, headed for the southern border, was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela.” (Pence, in remarks at the White House, Oct. 23)

“Need to look at political motives behind the caravan. Honduran politicians allied w Venezuelan & Cuban socialist dictators are encouraging the caravan to undermine US-friendly gov’t of Pres Hernandez.” (tweet from U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, Oct. 23)

Trump says Democrats might be behind the caravan, but has offered no evidence for this claim. Pence says he heard it was financed by leftist organizations and Venezuela. And don’t forget Cuba! (Haley didn’t.)

Here’s what The Washington Post’s Kevin Sieff and Joshua Partlow reported Oct. 24:

Although the caravan’s origin story remains somewhat opaque, the answer from many migrants here is that they had wanted to leave for months or years, and then — in a Facebook post, on a television program, in a WhatsApp group — they saw an image of the growing group and decided. “Right away, I knew I would go,” said Irma Rosales, 37, from Santa Ana, El Salvador, who saw images of the caravan on television and bought a bus ticket to meet up with the group in Guatemala last week. “I had been waiting for a way to get north, and then I heard about the caravan,” said Ediberto Fuentes, 30, who had fled Honduras for southern Mexico but was stranded for months, without the mon","The Trump administration has provided no evidence that criminals, members of the MS-13 gang or people of Middle Eastern descent form part of the caravan.

39,5346,Trump-o-Meter Promise: Get Congress to allow health insurance across state lines,Donald Trump,2017-03-15T00:00:00Z,Trump-O-Meter: | PolitiFact,politifact.com,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1390/get-congress-allow-health-insurance-across-state-l/,Trump-O-Meter,2017-03-15T19:05:35Z,Stalled,"Trump-O-Meter:Update: The administration released its proposal Jan. 5, 2018, to loosen the rules on association health plans. The measure retains protections on pre-existing conditions but would allow plans to cherry-pick the benefits they offer explicitly to reduce insurance premiums. The classic example would be to exclude maternity care because not everyone needs it.

The proposal offers a limited ability to sell insurance across state lines. That would be allowed in metropolitan areas, for example New York City or Kansas City where economic zones cross state borders. A final rule is many months away.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could open the door to making good on his promise to sell insurance across state lines. Whether it happens depends on the rules that finally emerge, and that's going to take some time.

There is no question as to Trump's intent. In October, he told various Cabinet departments ""to facilitate the purchase of insurance across state lines"" by drafting regulations on three fronts:

Expand access to association health plans

Expand access to short-term insurance

Expand access to health reimbursement accounts

The first two have the greatest potential to fundamentally change the kind of coverage that people can buy. Association plans are insurance set up by professions or clusters of small employers. You might see groups organized by home remodelers, accounting firms or some other line of work.

Under current law, these associations are treated as small employers and subject to key rules of the Affordable Care Act. For example, their plans must offer 10 essential benefits, like emergency room treatment and maternity care, and they can't discriminate based on a person's health.

The main effect of the executive order would be to lift those requirements.

Short-term plans offer limited benefits for up to three months. They're basically for people caught between jobs in need of catastrophic coverage until they land a new position. These plans operate under none of the Obamacare rules.

New regulations could allow these plans to last for many more months.

The administration doesn't enjoy complete freedom here. It must work within the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the law that sets minimum standards for private health plans. But in theory, the administration could craft language that allows association plans to follow the insurance rules in a state of their choosing, rather than the state where the person buying the plan lives.

Supporters see movement on both fronts as the path to cheaper insurance for millions of people. And that would likely happen in the short term. But a host of concerns surround such changes.

The ripple effects

Association and short-term plans would attract customers because they could offer skinnier coverage at a cheaper price. For people who think they are healthy, and likely to stay so, that would be an acceptable trade-off.

State insurance regulators fret over the implications. In Senate testimony, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners warned that association plans would ""cherry-pick the healthy.""

""This, in turn, would make existing state risk pools even riskier and more expensive for insurance carriers, thus making it even harder for sick groups to afford insurance,"" Raymond Farmer, the commissioner from South Carolina, said in September.

Many groups that focus on the stability of insurance markets caution that Trump's initiative would create two insurance universes. The one with association and short-term plans would have younger, healthier subscribers. The other would have older and sicker people. The costs in one would be low. The costs in the other would be high.

The Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health policy data, looked at a Senate proposal for association plans and predicted ""significant premium increases and instability"" in the small-group and non-group markets. The Kaiser analysis said that dynamic would be even more powerful if groups and individuals were able to use the cheaper plans when they were healthy, but then switch to traditional insurance when they got sick.

That might force insurers to get out of the market ""because they could not predict the risk of potential enrollees.""

As of publishing, we are still waiting on the administration's proposal. Even after that arrives, it will be at least several months before the public has a final rule.

But the wheels are turning, so we rate this promise In the Works.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could open the door to making good on his promise to sell insurance across state lines.

Falsely attributed quotes on social media that target politicians have become a popular form of misinformation, particularly as the 2020 election season enters its final stretch.

A phrase claiming to come from President Donald Trump that circulated in October 2015 is making the rounds again on social media platforms.

The article, allegedly published Oct. 27, 2015, claims Trump, while in Indianapolis, said African Americans are ""lazy."" The story does not reference a date or context for Trump speaking in that city.

The social media post contains what appears to be a picture of the print version of the article, which has ""'Africans Are Lazy, Good At Sex, Theft,'"" as a headline, above a photo of Trump. The article quotes Trump as referring to Africans and African Americans interchangeably.

“African Americans are very lazy,"" the article attributes to Trump. ""The best they can do is gallivanting around ghettoes, lamenting how they are discriminated. These are the people America doesn’t need. They are the enemies of progress. Look at African countries like Kenya for instance, those people are stealing from their own government and go to invest the money in foreign countries. From the government to opposition, they only qualify to be used as a case study whenever bad examples are required.""

The article also claims that Trump ""reiterated his promise to deport Africans especially those of Kenyan origin including their son (Barack) Obama.""

The story was republished by Nigerian and Zimbabwean websites, which cite a publication called Politica as the source,a fake news site, according to BBC News. All date the article Oct. 25 or Oct. 26 in 2015.

Politica has since deleted the original article.

Fact check:There's no evidence Donald Trump helped with 9/11 response

Trump's time was accounted for

The quote was attributed to Trump while he was campaigning for the White House.

Trump did speak publicly on Oct. 25, 2015, when he appeared on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" CNN's ""State of the Union,"" and ABC's ""This Week.""

Trump was active on Twitter that day, describing his media appearances throughout the morning.

Trump then said he would be traveling to New Hampshire that night for his appearance on NBC's ""Today"" show the next morning.

Any such comments would have been reported

Trump did not appear to make any public appearance in Indianapolis in October 2015.

At that time, Trump was the front-runner for the GOP nomination for president, and comments such as those claimed would have gained national attention. A study by the New York Times showed that by March 2016, Trump was being covered by ""free media"" outlets more than twice as much as his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

As an example, national media outlets gave ample coverage to his June 2015 comments accusing Mexican immigrants of bringing ""drugs"" and ""crime"" to America, as well as calling them rapists.

Fact check:Joe Biden has condemned protest-related violence all summer

Our ruling: False

There is no evidence that Trump said ""'Some Africans are lazy fools only good at eating, lovemaking and stealing,'"" or any of the other comments in the news item quoted in the social media posts. We rate this claim as FALSE, because it is not supported by our research, and was debunked previously when it circulated in 2015.

The untrue post features a 28-second clip uploaded on March 18 by a Facebook user showing an NBC News broadcast where Matt Sause, president and chief executive officer of Roche Diagnostics in North America was speaking at a press conference in front of the White House while standing next to Trump.

A graphic above the clip reads, “now, direct Trump announced that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine it invented next Sunday, and millions of doses are ready from it!!! –the end of the play.”

The post also carries this caption: “Great news for everyone. Carona (sic) virus vaccine invented.”

The video does not show either Sause or Trump announcing the launch of a vaccine to fight SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.

The short clip — lifted from NBC News’ 80-minute live coverage of Trump declaring a national emergency in the U.S on March 13 — shows Sause thanking the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for authorizing the emergency use of Roche’s newly developed SARS-CoV-2 testing kits.

A March 12 press release on the company’s website says the FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for their testing kits, meant to detect positive cases of COVID-19. The EUA means the kits are not yet cleared or approved by the FDA but are authorized for use in laboratories given the current emergency.

Roche’s testing kits can supposedly provide up to 96 test results in about three-and-a-half hours, the news release read. There are currently over 55,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases detected in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins case tracker.

In the Philippines, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), which conducts tests on suspected COVID-19 patients, takes 24 to 48 hours to produce test results.

The false FB post surfaced following reports that American pharmaceutical company, Kaiser Permanente, started conducting on March 16 the first trial of a coronavirus vaccine in humans in the U.S.

The netizen’s false and misleading post has already been shared over 2,700 times, gained over 1,100 reactions, and viewed more than 311,000 times since March 18.

Online mug shots of Trump are edited or AI-generated,"Viral photos of Donald Trump’s ‘mug shot’ are fakeFake mug shots of former president Donald Trump circulated online following his arraignment in New York. There’s no evidence Trump had a mug shot taken.

Example video title will go here for this video

Former President Donald Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and was arraigned in a New York City courtroom on April 4. Trump pleaded not guilty to each charge.

As part of the arraignment process, Trump had to officially surrender, which required him to do things like submit his fingerprints and appear before a judge.

After he appeared in court, photos claiming to show his mug shot went viral online.

On a level from 1-10 how happy are you that Trump has been ARRESTED? pic.twitter.com/QhTBdCq4uD — Nathalie Jacoby (@nathaliejacoby1) April 4, 2023

In an email to newsletter subscribers, the Trump campaign also included a photo showing a mug shot with the subject line: “NEW ITEM: mug shot.” The email has a T-shirt featuring a mug shot for sale, with the proceeds going directly to the Trump campaign.

THE QUESTION

Do these photos show Donald Trump’s mug shot from his New York arraignment?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No, these photos do not show Donald Trump’s mug shot from his New York arraignment. These mug shot photos are fake.

WHAT WE FOUND

The photos that have gone viral online are not real. Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press Trump did not have his mug shot taken at all. Trump’s attorney Joe Tacopina also told reporters on Tuesday, April 4 – the same day as his arraignment – that Trump didn't have his get his mug shot taken.

According to a post on DePaul University’s website, the purpose of the mug shot is to allow law enforcement to have a photographic record of all arrested individuals, and to allow for identification by victims and investigators.

The New York Times reported Trump would likely not have his mug shot taken because photographs of Trump are so widely available.

VERIFY reached out to Tacopina’s firm for comment but did not hear back at the time of publication.

Furthermore, New York state law doesn’t require police or courts to release mug shots of people involved in criminal prosecution.

A New York state law passed in 2019 says “disclosure of law enforcement arrest or booking photographs of an individual” is an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” unless disclosing the photographs serves a specific law enforcement purpose.

That means, if a mug shot of Trump did exist, it likely wouldn’t be released to the public.

An apparent Trump mug shot that went viral on Twitter was actually created using artificial intelligence technologies. VERIFY could not confirm which program was used, but in searching Midjourney, VERIFY found several examples of fake images being created to falsely show Trump arrested or in trial. Midjourney is a free artificial intelligence tool that allows the user to create realistic images.

Other similar artificially generated images have spread recently on social media and Midjourney related to Trump’s indictment, as VERIFY has previously reported.

There are subtle clues that confirm the AI mug shot image was digitally created. For example:

The background behind Trump doesn’t match what other mug shots typically look like in New York City – note the unfinished background and nail holes in the viral image.

Mug shots are typically taken at a police station and Trump never went to a police station on April 4 – he went straight to the courthouse.

In the AI-generated image, Trump is wearing a black T-shirt. In photos taken of Trump in the Manhattan Criminal Court by the Associated Press, Trump is wearing a blue suit jacket over a white shirt and a red tie.

The image the Trump campaign has been using on T-shirts also isn’t real. The photo used in that design has been widely used for other Trump merchandise. This Amazon poster for sale features the same photo – also falsely claiming to show a mug shot – and includes a placard dated Jan. 20, 2021.","Photos of former President Donald Trump's alleged mug shot circulated online after he was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and arraigned in a New York City courtroom. However, these photos are fake. Law enforcement officials confirmed that Trump did not have his mug shot taken, and his attorney also stated that he did not have one taken. New York state law does not require the release of mug shots of people involved in criminal prosecution, and a 2019 law considers the disclosure of such photos an ""unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."" Additionally, the viral image was created using artificial intelligence technologies, and there are subtle clues that confirm it was digitally created, such as the background not matching typical New York City mug shots and Trump wearing different clothing than he did in court."

“An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected,” Trump tweeted. “Must go with Election Night!”

The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018

Forging ballots, as Trump claims has happened in Florida, would be election fraud. Yet state and local officials have repeatedly said they have seen no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

As NBC reported on Sunday:

There’s also a dark irony in Trump’s demand coming on Veterans Day: If the recount were to be halted immediately, it would have the effect of disenfranchising overseas military personnel who submitted absentee ballots that can be tallied until November 16.

The president is far from the only Republican pushing evidence-free allegations of fraud. Shortly before Trump tweeted his claim that “An honest vote count is no longer possible” on Monday morning, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, whose lead over incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has shrunk to less than 13,000 at last count, went on Fox & Friends and accused Nelson of “trying to steal an election.”

During a Fox News appearance on Sunday, Scott was even more explicit, accusing Nelson of “clearly trying to commit fraud to win this election.”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has also cited a mistake Broward County officials made with 22 improperly cast ballots that were accidentally mixed in with valid provisional ones to make dark insinuations about possible widespread voter fraud.

#BrowardElections office admits the vote count they submitted to state includes 22 illegal votes.

In fact, the allegations made by Trump, Rubio, Scott, and others have been debunked by Scott’s own election monitors.

During a news conference last week, Scott asked state law enforcement to investigate “rampant fraud” related to the election. On Saturday, Florida State Department spokesperson Sarah Revell followed up in an email to reporters announcing that “Our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time.” The Washington Examiner reports, “Two staffers from Scott’s Department of Elections have been stationed in Broward County since at least Nov. 6 to oversee the administration of election processes,” and neither has reported any evidence of criminal activity.

Trump’s true concern appears to be making sure as many Republicans win elections as possible: Last Friday, he pushed similarly evidence-free accusations of fraud about the US Senate election in Arizona, where Republican Martha McSally now appears to have lost to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema after being slightly ahead on election night.

Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018

Trump’s tweet was seemingly in response to a Fox News segment that had just run about the Arizona Republican Party suing over the handling of ballots where there were issues with a voter’s signature. As Vox explained, the lawsuit actually “is about consistency in how the state matches signatures between ballots and voters, and whether voters should be called to verify their votes.” It has nothing to do with “Electoral corruption,” as Trump put it.","President Trump demanded on Monday morning that Florida halt its ongoing, legally required statewide recounts while the Republican candidates are still ahead, claiming, without evidence, that “many ballots are missing or forged” and the ballots are “massively infected.” “An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected,” Trump tweeted. “Must go with Election Night!” Forging ballots, as Trump claims has happened in Florida, would be election fraud.

Former President Donald Trump recently called for his supporters to protest after he said he may be arrested in New York for allegedly making hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with him.

Trump had predicted the indictment would come on Tuesday, March 21, and many media outlets are now reporting it may happen on Wednesday, March 22.

On March 20, a video was posted to Twitter and TikTok, claiming to show a large crowd gathering in front of Trump Tower in New York City. The video has more than 35,000 views.

“JUST IN: Americans begin to show up at Trump Tower in New York to express support for Former President Trump’s rumored arrest,” the tweet with the video said.

Many of the comments on the video questioned if it really does show the crowd of protesters in March 2023.

THE QUESTION

Does this video show a crowd of protesters in New York in March 2023?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No, this video does not show a crowd of protesters in New York in March 2023. The video is from 2020.

WHAT WE FOUND

The video wasn’t taken in March 2023, as the social media posts claim. It’s actually from October 2020 when Trump supporters caravanned from Long Island to New York City to cheer on the former president, who had just announced he tested positive for COVID-19.

VERIFY was able to confirm the video is three years old using video and photo forensics tools. VERIFY first used InVid to split the video into individual keyframes. We then used RevEye to conduct a reverse image search of each frame in the video.

At 15 seconds into the video, a man can be seen wrapped in a Trump 2020 flag. That same man, standing on top of the same vehicle, wrapped in the same flag, can be seen in a photo published by the New York Post on October 4, 2020.

According to that report, the caravan of supporters drove from Long Island and stayed parked in front of Trump Tower that afternoon.

Shawn Farash, a New York-based community organizer, replied to accounts that shared the video, also confirming the video isn’t from March 2023.

“This is not Sunday 3/19,” one reply said. “This was October 4th 2020. How do I know? Because my organization put this rally together,” Farash wrote.

A Facebook event page for the caravan can be found here, with Farash listed as the organizer.

In another tweet, Farash wrote: “Anyone who sees video of a rally outside of Trump Tower, know that it is NOT HAPPENING TODAY. It is OLD VIDEO from a rally that my organization put together on OCTOBER 4TH 2020.”

A New York grand jury voted to indict former President Donald Trump on Thursday, March 30 on charges involving alleged hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump.

Though other former presidents have faced legal trouble in the past, former New York state legislator Jon Cooper claimed in a viral tweet on March 12 that Trump would be the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally indicted.

THE QUESTION

Is Donald Trump the first former president to be indicted?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

Yes, Donald Trump is the first former president to be indicted.

WHAT WE FOUND

Donald Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted in U.S. history, according to Jeremi Suri, Ph.D., a history and public affairs professor at The University of Texas at Austin.

VERIFY was unable to find any federal records of former presidents being indicted, confirming Suri’s assertion. But there are at least two who came close: Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.

The National Archives released an indictment that was drafted, but never used, against Nixon for charges related to the cover-up of a break-in and wiretap at the Democratic National Committee office. The political scandal, known as Watergate, ultimately led to Nixon’s resignation in 1974.

But Nixon never faced any charges in connection to Watergate. That’s because President Gerald Ford granted Nixon a “full, free and absolute pardon” for any crimes, protecting him from prosecution.

Though Nixon was pardoned, other people within his administration were convicted or pleaded guilty and served prison terms.

Clinton also avoided indictment after he lied in a deposition about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky while he was president. He reached a deal with prosecutors, admitting that he gave false testimony under oath, the Washington Post reported in January 2001.

According to the Post, Clinton also reached an agreement with Arkansas authorities to pay $25,000 in fines and have his law license suspended for five years.

Suri said former President Ronald Reagan also came close to indictment for a political scandal known as the Iran-Contra Affair, in which his administration sold weapons to Iran to free American hostages held in Lebanon. But Reagan never faced any charges.

While Trump’s indictment marks the first for a former president, there are reports that President Ulysses S. Grant was the first to be arrested while in office.

An archived article published by the Evening Star newspaper in 1908 recounted the story of Grant’s arrest.

In 1872, while Grant was president, he was stopped and arrested in 1872 for speeding through the streets of Washington, D.C. in his horse-drawn carriage, the newspaper reported.

“I am very sorry, Mr. President, to have to do it, for you are the chief of the nation, and I am nothing but a policeman, but duty is duty, sir, and I will have to place you under arrest,” former Police Officer William West reportedly told Grant.","Donald Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted in U.S. history, according to Jeremi Suri, a history and public affairs professor at The University of Texas at Austin.

President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020, hasn’t yet announced a final decision on whether he will run for reelection.

Ahead of Trump’s announcement, several VERIFY readers have asked if the former president could serve two more terms if he is reelected in 2024.

THE QUESTION

Could former President Trump serve two more terms if he is reelected?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

No, former President Trump couldn’t serve two more terms if he is reelected.

WHAT WE FOUND

Presidential term limits are established by the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified on Feb. 27, 1951. The Republican-controlled Congress championed the amendment after former President Franklin Roosevelt won four consecutive terms, according to The National Constitution Center.

The 22nd Amendment reads in part:

“No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.”

That means an elected president can only serve two terms in office for a total of eight years. Since Trump has already served one term as president, he’d only be eligible to serve for one more, even though the terms wouldn’t be consecutive.

Some members of Congress have tried to repeal the 22nd Amendment since it was ratified more than 70 years ago, but the resolutions have never made it out of committee, the National Constitution Center says.

More from VERIFY: No, being convicted of taking government records would not disqualify Trump from serving as president again

There is a loophole in the 22nd Amendment that allows someone to serve up to ten years as president, the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center explains. But it doesn’t apply to Trump.

If a vice president or other successor takes over for a president who can’t finish out their term, and that person serves two years or less of the former president’s term, they would be eligible to serve two full four-year terms afterward.

But if the successor serves more than two years of the former president’s term, they can only serve for one more term afterward, the center says.

If Trump were to win reelection in 2024, he’d be the first president in more than a century to serve two nonconsecutive terms.","Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to run for president in 2024, prompting questions about whether he could serve two more terms if reelected.

Bank regulations were rolled back under Trump in 2018.,"Yes, bank regulations were rolled back during the Trump administrationFormer President Trump signed a law that rolled back regulations for some banks. But the original rules may not have prevented the SVB and Signature Bank failures.

Example video title will go here for this video

On March 10, federal regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank after many depositors rushed to withdraw their funds all at once.

The federal takeover marked the second-largest bank failure since the collapse of Washington Mutual during the 2008 financial crisis. Two days after the Silicon Valley Bank failure, regulators seized New-York based Signature Bank.

In the days after the banks collapsed, people online, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), claimed former President Donald Trump “rolled back” regulations for banks. President Joe Biden also addressed the purported rollback of regulations during a speech on March 13.

“During the Obama-Biden administration, we put in place tough requirements on banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, including the Dodd-Frank Law, to make sure the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again,” Biden said. “Unfortunately, the last administration rolled back some of these requirements.”

THE QUESTION

Were bank regulations rolled back during the Trump administration?

THE SOURCES

THE ANSWER

Yes, bank regulations were rolled back during the Trump administration. But it’s difficult to say whether the stricter requirements would have prevented the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks.

WHAT WE FOUND

In May 2018, former President Donald Trump signed a law to roll back stricter requirements for banks like SVB that were put into place nearly eight years earlier.

In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act during former President Barack Obama’s administration. The legislation aimed to “prevent the excessive risk-taking” that led to the 2008 financial crisis, the Obama White House said at the time.

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed certain requirements on “systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs),” or banks with at least $50 billion in assets.

In 2018, Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act into law, which raised that threshold to $250 billion. But it did give the Federal Reserve the option to apply stricter requirements for banks with at least $100 billion in assets.

The requirements outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act included annual “stress tests” conducted by the Federal Reserve, enhanced capital and liquidity standards, and a “living will” that would detail a bank’s plan for resolution in the event of a failure, according to a 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

A “stress test” is a simulation or analysis conducted to assess how a bank will be impacted under adverse market conditions, such as a market crash or recession, the Corporate Finance Institute explains.

More from VERIFY: Why people with up to $250K in their bank account are protected in a bank collapse

“The rationale for the rollback in 2018 was that [the regulations] were imposing a burden on these smaller institutions and, by removing that, then they can perform their functions a bit better,” David Ely, a finance professor at San Diego State University, said.

Silicon Valley Bank, which had $209 billion in assets at the end of 2022, would have automatically been subject to the stricter Dodd-Frank rules if the pre-2018 threshold were still in place today, Ely said.

This is also the case for Signature Bank, which had just over $110 billion in assets at the end of 2022.

After the recent bank failures, U.S. Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Sen. Warren and other lawmakers introduced legislation to bring back the stricter Dodd-Frank regulations. But it’s difficult to say whether those requirements would have prevented the bank collapses.

“I think the fundamental causes of their collapse were more due to some poor management decisions, and maybe some red flags that were overlooked in the basic regulation of the institution,” Ely said.

Silicon Valley Bank had many investments in long-term government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which plummeted in value as the Fed raised interest rates. Both Silicon Valley and Signature Banks also had a high number of deposits that were not insured by the federal government, making them “more vulnerable to bank runs,” Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, told VERIFY.","Bank regulations were rolled back during the Trump administration, but it is unclear if stricter requirements would have prevented the collapse of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. In 2018, Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which raised the threshold for ""systemically important financial institutions"" from $50 billion to $250 billion in assets. This rollback was intended to ease the burden on smaller institutions, allowing them to function better. However, some argue that the fundamental causes of the recent bank failures were due to poor management decisions and overlooked red flags, rather than the rollback of regulations."

One such tweeted forgery recently popped up again on Facebook.

A screenshot of a tweet Pelosi supposedly sent out late last year has been posted with the claim, “I’m glad someone got a snapshot of this before deleting it.”



The image has been shared a depressing 138,952 times on the platform.

No, Pelosi never tweeted that statement. 1) There’s no record of the tweet ever existing, 2) there is a watermark in the bottom right of the image for Tweeterino.com, a defunct site that allowed people to create parody tweets. (What’s worse than Twitter? Tweeterino, apparently.)

While many commenters pointed out the falsehood, others chose to keep the faith. “Fake or not that is the dems sentiment, they look at the hard working middle class as their cash cow!!!” one motivated user wrote. Others suggested that while fact checkers had previously debunked this particular tweet, they could not be trusted. “I wouldn't necessarily trust Snopes or politico as they are very biased.” Regardless of perceived bias, this image is clearly fake—the watermark is a dead giveaway.

A rule of thumb, dear readers: When in doubt, don’t share. (And always be in doubt.)

To be safe, we might as well just smash the internet .
